// The document arrives in passes: the Qobuz page first, then the Magazine
// stories, then MusicBrainz Origin -> Relationships -> Discovery (see
// artist_qt.rs). Each MB section renders its own "Loading…" line and, when
// MusicBrainz is off in Settings or the artist has no confident MB match, is
// simply ABSENT — never an error frame, and nothing is requested.
//
// Blacklist banner, Artist Scene, Create Collection, both radio engines,
// multi-select and the sticky JUMP TO bar are live. The remaining artist-page
// deltas are documented beside their data producers in artist_qt.rs.
//
// "Share" left this list when the seam landed: the ⋯ entry now calls
// QbzArtist.share (artist_bridge.rs -> src/share_qt.rs), which copies
// play.qobuz.com/artist/{id} and raises the same "Link copied" toast as
// ArtistPageView.slint:530-538 / main.rs:12749.
//
// Header atmosphere (ArtistPageView.slint:120-147, 211-247): wired through
// the shared controls/HeaderGradient.qml — the SAME component AlbumView
// mounts, because the .slint paints both headers from identical blocks. It
// carries the .slint's header-colour rules with it (light text + overlay
// CircleActions while the band is on).

    // Owner, 2026-08-02: "el error esta en que nunca cargan mas albumes."
    // The old handler parsed the page and pushed it into
    // `artist.releaseSections[i].cards` IN PLACE, then fired artistChanged().
    // Both Repeaters (`model: releaseSections` at :1997/:2114 and
    // `model: section.cards` inside ReleaseSection) were then handed the very
    // SAME array object they already held, and the unfiltered arm below used
    // to `return all` — the identical array again. Nothing was dirty, so
    // nothing rebuilt: the page was fetched, parsed and appended to a data
    // structure no view ever re-read. This tree already writes the rule down,
    // in cards/PlaylistCollage.qml: "Rebind requires a NEW object reference."
    // (PRE-EXISTING, not a regression from today's smooth-append work — that
    // pass only added the `releaseMoreLanded` call to the handler. What it
    // changed is that the button now shows an in-flight placeholder, which is
    // what made a silent no-op visible.)

    // So the appended pages live in `root.releaseOverlay` (see its header)
    // and are merged HERE, which builds a NEW section object with a NEW cards
    // array whenever the overlay has anything for that bucket — the one thing
    // that actually invalidates both Repeaters. `artist` is never mutated, so
    // a republish of the document (the progressive Magazine / MusicBrainz
    // passes) cannot lose the tail either.
    //
    // De-dup by album id is MANDATORY on this path and not merely defensive:
    // artist_qt.rs `merge_release_page` (:686) folds every landed page into
    // the STASHED document too, so the moment the next enrichment pass
    // republishes, the document already carries the cards the overlay holds.
