// The Local Library album collection — the Qt equivalent of
// discover/AlbumCollectionView.slint as LocalLibraryView.slint mounts it
// (:1255 Albums, :1601 Folders-flat, :2409 Artists detail): grid or list,
// grouped or flat, with the source badge and multi-select.
//
// WHY A CHUNK MODEL AND NOT A GridView + Repeater
// The Slint calls this a "chunked grid" and it is the one surface with the
// documented 16k-row freeze. Here EVERY arm is a single windowing ListView
// over a flat "entry" array:
//     { t: 0, label }                 -> group header (34px)
//     { t: 1, items: [...], base: n } -> one visual row of cards, or one
//                                        list row; `base` is the row's
//                                        first index in the flat album array
// so grouping costs one O(n) rebuild when the inputs change (never per
// frame) and the mounted delegate count stays proportional to the viewport,
// not to the library. Artwork is reported from the mounted entry range only,
// via the host's windowing helpers.
