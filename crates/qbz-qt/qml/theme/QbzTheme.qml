    //   discover/BrowseHeaderTools.slint:123 + :132  (glyph AND label)
    //   favorites/FavoritesView.slint:301 + :309     (glyph AND label)
    // Measured against every accent in qbz-theme's registry.rs, that white
    // falls UNDER 2.6:1 on 16 of the 35 shipped palettes — high-contrast
    // 1.70, ikari 1.74, wcag-dark 1.82, kurosaki 1.85, ayanami 1.87,
    // frost 2.00, catppuccin-mocha 2.03, aurora 2.04, macchiato 2.15,
    // frappe 2.20, warm 2.33, zoey 2.41, dracula 2.41, breeze-dark 2.49,
    // tokyo-night 2.52, rumi 2.53.
    //
    // Read the head of that list before the tail: `high-contrast` (accent
    // #62d4ff) is the WORST row in the app at 1.70:1 and `wcag-dark`
    // (#9ec1ff) is third at 1.82:1. Those are the two ACCESSIBILITY
    // palettes — the ones whose entire reason to exist is contrast — and
    // upstream paints their glyph at a ratio that fails every WCAG
    // threshold there is. Everything after them is a dark theme with a
    // bright accent. This is not the light-theme polarity bug the tint
    // vocabulary already fixed, it is a separate defect that comes from
    // upstream, so porting it 1:1 would ship it. The owner ruled the
    // divergence in ("si venía mal de origen es una posibilidad"); every
    // call site that takes it says so and cites the .slint line it departs
    // from.
    //
    // The count is 16, not the 14 an earlier pass wrote here and at five
    // other call sites: that pass had dropped exactly the two accessibility
    // rows, i.e. the strongest evidence for diverging. Every number in this
    // block was re-derived from the 35 `fn * -> ThemeColors` bodies in
    // qbz-theme/src/registry.rs (resolving the `..dark()` spread, the
    // `let accent = ...` shorthand and the StdSpec builder) and spot-checked
    // against an independent contrast tool. Re-derive before editing them.
    //
    // THE OBVIOUS FIX — "just use accent-text" — IS ALSO WRONG. That token is
    // chosen for the theme's TEXT ramp on an accent surface, not for an
    // 11-20px glyph, and it is not universally better: on Rose Pine Dawn
    // (accent #d7827e, accent-text #575279) a check glyph goes from 7.38:1
    // at #000000 to 2.56:1 — UNDER the 3:1 non-text floor. So the durable
    // answer is a SELECTOR, not a constant.
    //
    // THE RULE — theme intent first, floor-guarded:
    //   1. `accentText`, whenever it clears `accentFloor` against the LIVE
    //      accent. It is the theme author's own on-accent colour, and — via
    //      `accentGlyphColor` — it is what the sibling LABELS across the app
    //      resolve to on 34 of the 35 rows (FilterChip, CastPicker,
    //      LocalToolbar, the GenreFilterPopup chips ...), so the glyph and
    //      the label agree by construction instead of by luck.
    //   2. otherwise the extreme that survives best, "white" or "black".
    //      Only Rose Pine Dawn reaches branch 2 today (-> black, 7.38:1).
    //   3. and, if branch 2 cannot clear the floor either, a documented last
    //      resort — see `accentGlyphTint` below. Unreachable on all 35
    //      registry rows and on `custom`; reachable on `auto`.
    // Worst REST case after the selector, over all 35 registry rows: 3.04:1
    // (breeze-light). Before: 1.70:1 (high-contrast). Hover is a separate
    // number and is stated as such below — do not quote 3.04 for both.
    //
    // WHY THE FLOOR IS 3.0 AND NOT 4.5. The glyph is non-text — WCAG 1.4.11
    // asks 3:1. Raising the bar to 4.5 would push Dark / Light / OLED
    // (accent #4285f4, accent-text #ffffff, 3.56:1) off their own accent-text
    // and onto a BLACK glyph: repainting the DEFAULT theme's play button is a
    // far larger deviation than the bug being fixed. The label twin
    // deliberately inherits the same floor rather than the 4.5:1 body-text
    // one — item-for-item agreement with the glyph beats a per-role
    // threshold that would split the two halves of one pill apart again,
    // which is the defect being repaired in BrowseGenreButton / LibraryView.
    //
    // WHY THERE IS NO `accentHoverGlyphTint` SIBLING. This was checked, not
    // assumed: running the same rule against `accentHover` picks a DIFFERENT
    // arm on 6 of the 35 palettes (breeze-light, dark, light, oled,
    // duotone-snow, rose-pine-dawn), so a second property would flip the
    // glyph white->black under the cursor on the three default themes. A
    // glyph that changes colour on hover is a worse defect than the dip it
    // would fix.
    //
    // The dip, stated honestly, because an earlier pass here quoted Dark's
    // 2.83:1 as the worst hover case and it is not: holding the selector's
    // rest-time choice across both fills, the worst HOVER ratio over the 35
    // rows is BREEZE-LIGHT at 2.49:1 — its `accent-text` IS #ffffff and its
    // accentHover is #3daee9 — then Dark / Light / OLED at 2.83:1 (#ffffff
    // on #5a9bf4) and duotone-snow at 2.84:1. All four are what ships today
    // and what the owner has never reported; none of them is what the 3.04:1
    // headline above measures, which is rest only.
    //
    // The hover fill is folded into the FALLBACK arm instead: once
    // accent-text is out, the winning extreme is the one that holds on
    // accent AND accentHover, so a diverging theme's choice cannot depend on
    // which state the control is in.

    // 2026-07-29, after the 50px deviation turned out to have a cost nobody
    // had priced.
    //
    // The 50px came from an earlier owner request: the 64px rail read as a
    // wide empty gutter. But 50 made two references irreconcilable — the rail
    // centres its 34px row at 25, while the header's own sidebar toggle sits
    // at centre 30 (spacingMd + half of 28). Five pixels apart, one directly
    // above the other, which is what the owner saw and reported as "not
    // centred": symmetric padding inside the rail still looked wrong because
    // the eye lines the glyphs up against the header control, not against the
    // rail. Slint never had the problem — at 64 the row centres at 32, two
    // pixels off the header button and imperceptible. Chasing it from inside
    // the rail (12/4 padding) bought the header alignment at the price of a
    // visibly asymmetric hover pill; the root fix is the width.

    // `width - 2 * spacingSm` formula happened to yield 34, which is why the
    // two tokens were coupled — but Slint pins BOTH independently (rail 64px,
    // row 34px at Sidebar.slint:575/652), so the same formula at 64 would give
    // 48 and silently grow every row. Deriving it was the trap the previous

    // drift apart when the breakpoints move.
    //
    // NOT here: Classic's fixed 0.324 side column. That is a per-MODE
    // override (PlayerBar.slint:149), not a breakpoint — Classic ignores the
