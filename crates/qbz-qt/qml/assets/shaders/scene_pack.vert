#version 440

// PAIRED with tunnel.frag AND aurora.frag (their uniform layouts are
// identical, so one vertex stage serves both).
//
// THE PAIRING RULE (2026-08-15 black-Tunnel report): a ShaderEffect's two
// stages are LINKED into one program under the OpenGL RHI backend, and GLSL
// refuses one block name with two layouts ("uniform `_22' declared as type
// `buf' and type `buf'"). Vulkan never links stages, so the shared
// spectrum.vert (block = qt_Matrix + qt_Opacity) paired with these wider
// fragment blocks rendered fine there and died only on GL. The fix is Qt's
// own documented pattern: BOTH stages declare the SAME block, member for
// member, in the same order — the vertex stage simply never reads the
// fragment-only fields. Keep this block byte-identical to tunnel.frag's.
