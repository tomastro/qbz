#version 440

// Plasma (immersive scene, mode 1) — FRAGMENT stage. Line-faithful GLSL 440
// port of `fs_main` in crates/qbz-ui/ui/shaders/plasma.wgsl (the MilkDrop-
// class feedback fluid: sample the previous frame at a warped UV, decay,
// inject orbiting ink + beat splats). The feedback history lives in two
// RGBA8 ping-pong textures owned by the C++ PlasmaItem (the reference keeps
// ONE history and copies the frame back — shader_underlay.rs:1003-1025 —
// which is the same recurrence; ping-pong is how you say "sample last frame,
// write this frame" without a surface readback).
//
// Mechanical differences from the WGSL, enumerated:
//   * textureSample(prev_tex, prev_samp, uv) -> texture(prev_tex, uv)
//     (combined image sampler, binding 1).
//   * bitcast<u32>(i32(x)) -> uint(int(x)): int->uint is a modulo-2^32
//     conversion in GLSL, i.e. the same bit pattern the WGSL bitcast keeps.
//   * The uniform block is the FULL 144-byte std140 scene block (spec 01
//     §1) — this scene reads time/resolution/energy_lo/energy_hi.x/beat/
//     level/level_smooth/primary/secondary/accent; the remaining fields
//     arrive zeroed.
//
// QSB-SKIP-GLES100 — the lattice hash is UINT arithmetic (plasma.wgsl:55-67
// records why a float hash draws "wallpaper join" seams); ES 2.0 has no
// uint. The tier gate keeps the scene off that hardware.

// -- WHY THIS LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES (2026-08-19 rework) --------------------
//
// The reference is Butterchurn (MilkDrop in JS) on a percussion-heavy track,
// and the frame-by-frame gives the recipe in three parts:
//
//   1. CONCENTRIC RINGS. They are not drawn as rings. ONE thin annulus is
//      injected per frame, and the feedback warp marches it inward — so the
//      rings you see ARE the last N frames of audio, laid out in space. Time
//      becomes geometry. That only works if a trail survives long enough to
//      stack, which is the second part.
//   2. HIGH RETENTION. MilkDrop presets hold ~0.97+ per frame. This shader
//      held 0.85: a trail died in ~15 frames, so nothing ever accumulated and
//      four soft blobs orbited an empty field — "a Windows 98 wallpaper",
//      accurately.
//   3. ANGULAR STRUCTURE. The spokes come from reading the spectrum BY ANGLE,
//      so each direction carries its own band, and from folding the plane into
//      mirrored sectors.
//
// Deliberately NOT here: a preset engine, per-preset equations, custom
// shapes/waves. This is Plasma made intense, not MilkDrop reimplemented.

// The spectrum sampled AT AN ANGLE (0..1 around the circle), interpolated
// between the 8 bands so a spoke sweeps rather than steps. This is what turns
// a flat field into radial structure.

    //
    // So the annulus is GATED BY ANGLE. Only the sectors whose gate opens emit,
