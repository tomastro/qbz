// ScrollMemory — per-page scroll-position memory for the back/forward stack.
//
// THE PORT of the block Slint repeats in 27 views (`property <string>
// sr-armed: NavState.restore-scope; changed viewport-height => { if
// (NavState.restore-scope == "<scope>" && ...) { viewport-y =
// NavState.scroll-restore; NavState.restore-scope = ""; } }` plus `changed
// viewport-y => NavState.report-scroll(...)`). Slint had to inline it because
// a `.slint` file cannot hand a component a reference to a Flickable; QML can,
// so this exists ONCE and every view mounts it beside its scroll container:
//
//     ScrollMemory { target: pageFlick; scope: "album" }
//
// Two halves, and they are independent:
//
//   REPORT — every `contentY` change is pushed to `QbzShell.reportScroll`,
//   which stores (scope, y) in nav_qt::LIVE. Nothing reads it until a
//   navigation stamps the page it is leaving, which is the whole point of the
//   design: the ~40 `record` call sites never learn that scroll memory exists.
//   This is a bare store per scroll frame — no notify, no binding, no
//   allocation once the page has reported once — and it is what Slint does.
//
//   RESTORE — `nav_qt::step` (back/forward) arms `QbzShell.restoreScope` with
//   the SCOPE the destination stored and `QbzShell.scrollRestore` with its
//   saved offset BEFORE it publishes `currentView`, so by the time the
//   router's Loader has built this view the arming is already on the bridge.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THE RESTORE RE-ASSERTS INSTEAD OF FIRING ONCE
// ============================================================================
//
// The first cut set `contentY` the moment the content was tall enough and then
// dropped the arming. That is not enough, and the reason is not specific to
// one view:
//
//   A Qt Quick item view RESETS contentY TO 0 WHENEVER ITS MODEL IS REPLACED
//   (`QQuickItemView::setModel`), and several of this app's pages assign their
//   model from a binding whose inputs arrive over the network AFTER the mount.
//
// The album page is the clean example. `AlbumView.qml:208` builds `listCells`
// from the track rows PLUS three deferred rails ("more from this artist",
// "suggestions", "similar albums"), each of which flips a loading flag and
// then lands its own document. So a freshly-mounted album page hands its
// ListView a NEW array one to four times in its first couple of seconds, and
// every one of those snaps the list back to the top — over a restore that had
// already run correctly.
//
// (The same reset also throws a plain forward visit to the top if a rail lands
// while you are reading. The re-assert below only stops it from eating the
// restore; fixing that properly means giving those rails a model of their own,
// which is an AlbumView change and not this file's business.)
//
// So the offset is held in `_wanted` and re-applied on every contentHeight
// change, every count change and every contentY move we did not make, until
// one of:
//
//   - `settleMs` elapses — the page never grew back that far (the album lost
//     tracks, a filter changed), so it lands on whatever is reachable and lets
//     go; or
//   - THE USER TAKES OVER. A wheel, a drag or a flick all raise `moving`, and
//     from that instant the position is theirs. This is the guard that keeps a
//     re-asserting restore from fighting the person using it.
//
// The shared scope is still consumed IMMEDIATELY on the first match, so two
// containers in one view can never both claim it; only this instance's private
// `_armed` latch outlives that.
//
// GATED ON `visible`. Tabbed views (Library, Local Library, Discover) mount
// more than one scroll container and only one of them holds the active tab's
// content; the others sit at contentY 0 with an empty model. Without the gate
// an inactive container's relayout would report 0 over the live page's real
// offset.
//
// GPU doctrine: nothing here animates. The restore is a handful of property
// assignments on one navigation, and at rest this component writes nothing.
//
// DIAGNOSTICS. Off by default (a LoggingCategory at Warning emits nothing at
// Info). One run says which link broke — the report, the arming or the apply:
//
//     QT_LOGGING_RULES="qbz.nav.scroll.info=true" ./target/release/qbz
//
// The Rust half of the same story is `log::debug!` under `[qbz-qt] scroll:` in
// nav_qt.rs (what got stamped, what got armed), i.e. `RUST_LOG=qbz=debug`.
