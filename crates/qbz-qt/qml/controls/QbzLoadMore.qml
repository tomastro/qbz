// QbzLoadMore — THE shared "Load more" affordance, app-wide.
//
// Consolidates the FIVE hand-rolled copies this tree grew, in three visually
// distinct shapes. Every one of them is reproduced here PIXEL FOR PIXEL in its
// idle state; the arms are `bordered` and nothing else:
//   a. views/ArtistView.qml:1122-1147   — release section. Plain centred Text,
//      13px, 28 tall, hit box `implicitWidth + 24`, hover textPrimary /
//      textSecondary. NETWORK-BACKED (QbzArtist.loadReleaseSection).
//   b. views/ArtistView.qml:1596-1617   — Popular Tracks expander. Same plain
//      shape; the label toggles "Load more" / "View less" and the action is
//      CLIENT-SIDE (instant, no fetch) — so it passes `label` and never `busy`.
//   c. views/SearchView.qml:249-283     — `LoadMoreButton`: the BORDERED pill
//      (radiusSm, 32 tall, `implicitWidth + 36`, 1px borderSubtle, surfaceCard
//      idle / surfaceElevated hover) at y:6 inside a 44-tall box. Its label
//      carries the "n / total" counter, so the HOST owns the whole string.
//   d. views/LabelReleasesView.qml:269-296 — plain shape with a "Loading…"
//      arm and the MouseArea disarmed while loading (32 tall there).
//   e. views/LabelView.qml:549-583      — client-side 5 -> 20 -> 50 -> 5
//      reveal, plain shape, 28 tall.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS (owner, 2026-08-02) ────────────────────────────────────
// "Los LoadMore dan una carga de golpe, se ve viejo, carguemos una o dos filas
//  skeleton loader debajo del boton y que la aparicion de lo que se cargue,
//  sea smooth."
// So: while a fetch is in flight, one row of card placeholders (or one/two row
// placeholders) sits UNDER the button. BELOW, not above — that is what the
// owner asked for, literally, and it is also the honest position: the page
// that is being fetched will be appended BELOW the content that is already on
// screen, and the button is the bottom of that content. (SearchView.qml:668
// already mounted such a block, but ABOVE its button; the consumer pass moves
// it. The 8000ms settle bound and the 224x270 pitch come from that site.)
//
// ── WHAT THIS CONTROL DOES *NOT* DO ────────────────────────────────────────
// The other half of "smooth" — the APPEARANCE of what landed — lives in the
// CONSUMERS. Only a host knows which of its delegates are new (it holds the
// index the page started at), so only a host can fade the appended delegates
// in. This control owns the placeholder and the button; it never touches the
// host's model.
// `visible` is likewise NOT decided here: every one of the five sites already
// gates its own instance (`section.hasMore`, `doc.hasMore`, `loaded < total`,
// `topTracks.length > preview`). The only visibility rule below is the
// skeleton block's own.
//
// ── COST ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The skeleton is the SHARED controls/QbzSkeleton.qml COMPOSITE, never a new
// primitive: ONE instance draws a whole row of cells on ONE animator (see that
// file's COST note). It is mounted through a Loader that is only `active`
// while the block is on screen, so an idle Load-more button holds no
// rectangles and no timer at all. `selfDrive: true` gives that one short-lived
// instance its own 900ms phase (there is no host phase to borrow — the button
// may be the only skeleton on the page), and `settleMs: 8000` bounds it, so a
// fetch that never returns cannot shimmer forever.
