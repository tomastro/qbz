// TrackRow — THE track list row (primitives/TrackRow.slint, POC arm
// subset), consolidated in phase 22 from FOUR copies (AlbumView
// .AlbumTrackRow, PlaylistView.PlTrackRow, LibraryView.TrackListRow,
// SearchView.SearchTrackRow). 50px, radius 8: number→play cell (pause
// swap + accent pill when it is the now-playing row — Slint-universal),
// optional 36px art cell, title+explicit / artist column, optional 220px
// album link, duration, quality (BARE QualityBadgeFull — the tier label over
// the exact bit-depth / sample-rate line), optional
// heart, optional download slot (offline column — glyph stub or reserved
// spacer until the offline cache lands, POC-NOTE), ⋯ CardMenu.
//
// item contract: { id, title, artist, artistId, album, albumId, number?,
// duration, qualityTier, qualityDetail, explicit, isFavorite, artPath? }
// (plus playlistTrackId for the remove-from-playlist arm, and the OPTIONAL
// `source` / `unavailable` a mixed-source producer carries — the Add to
// playlist gate below is the one arm that reads them, plus the OPTIONAL
// `qobuzUnavailable`, which is a DIFFERENT thing from `unavailable` and is
// documented where it is read). `qualityDetail`
// is the bare exact-quality string ("16-bit / 44.1 kHz"); when a producer
// does not carry it yet the badge degrades to the tier label alone rather
// than to a blank cell. `item.isFavorite` SEEDS the row's own `favorite`
// property and is never written back — see the heart block below for why a
// plain-JS-object field cannot be the live state.
//
// Arms: showArtwork / showAlbum / showFavorite / showDownload /
// downloadGlyph / showMenu / zebra / artistLink / clickPlays /
// menuShowLater / menuShowGoTo / menuShowFavorite / menuShowRemove.
// (`qualityStyle` is RETIRED — kept declared, inert, see below.)
// Signals: playRequested() (per-site play: album-scoped, playlist-scoped
// or plain), enqueueRequested(mode) ("next"|"later"|"queue"),
// removeRequested(), bodyDragStarted(index) (fired BEFORE the shared
// dragStart — the #589 reorder pre-hook), mixtapeRequested() (the host
// builds the MyQBZ AddItem payload), goToRequested(kind) (only when
// `routeGoToExternally` is set), playlistAddRequested() (only when
// `routePlaylistAddExternally` is set — the local-mode "Add to playlist"),
// replaceRequested() (only when `routeReplaceExternally` is set — the
// "Find available version" repair for a track Qobuz pulled).
// Favorite toggling, Go-to-artist/album, Share and Track info are
// identical on every site — handled internally. The row BODY is the drag
// source (6px threshold, ghost + sidebar drops in main.rs) and its RIGHT
// press opens the very same menu the ⋯ button does.
//
// --- Menu inventory vs primitives/TrackContextMenu.slint ----------------
// The .slint menu is FLAT (no separators) in this order: Play now · Play
// next · Play later · Add to queue · Create QBZ radio · Create Qobuz radio ·
// Add to library · Add to mixtape · Add to playlist · Remove from
// playlist(danger) · Share Qobuz link · Share Song.link · Make available
// offline | Refresh + Remove offline copy(danger) · Go to album · Go to
// artist · Track info. Everything the Qt bridge has a seam for is here, in
// that order; the rest is gated OFF by the `has*Seam` constants below
// rather than rendered as a row that silently does nothing.
//
// Deliberately NOT consolidated here (Slint-distinct): QueuePanel.QueueRow
// (QueueItem data + queue-op menu + press-and-hold reorder) and
// LibraryView.FeedListRow (mixed-kind feed row — inline in Slint too).
//
// --- COLUMN GEOMETRY LIVES IN rows/TrackCols.qml ------------------------
// Not in this file. rows/TrackListHeader.qml reads the same object, so the
// header of a list and the rows in it cannot disagree. If you change a
// column width, change it THERE — a literal typed back into this file is
// the exact defect the owner reported (the header laid out only the
// labelled columns, so every label sat right of the column it named).

    // ListView is not mouse-drag-scrollable, so its row-body drag has no
    // competitor. Qt's is — every one of these rows lives in a Flickable, and
    // a Flickable filters its children's mouse events and takes the grab once
    // the press travels past `QStyleHints.startDragDistance` (~10px). Our
    // drag arms at 6px, so BOTH fire: the ghost appears, the list then takes
    // the grab, this area gets `canceled` and never `released`, `dragging`
    // stays true and the ghost never ends.
    //
    // The resolution is the one this port ALREADY made for the same collision
    // in shell/QueuePanel.qml:479-491 — `preventStealing` scoped to the rows
    // that are actually reorderable, described there as "the Qt equivalent of
    // QueueSidebar.slint's `interactive: false` on the queue Flickable, but
    // without that side effect: Qt's Flickable also drops WHEEL events when
    // it is non-interactive, so wheel + scrollbar keep working, and only a
    // press that starts ON a reorderable row is denied to the flick." Same
    // trade here, same shape, so the two reorderable lists in the app behave
    // identically: while a list is reorderable it is not drag-scrollable, and
    // the wheel and the scrollbar carry scrolling.
    //
    // Scoped to `showReorder` on purpose: on every OTHER surface the row-body
    // drag is the add-to-a-sidebar-playlist gesture, which shipped with the
    // >6px arm and drag-scroll both live, and re-timing it is not this
    // round's job. `onCanceled` below is the universal half — it costs no
    // gesture change and it is what stops a stolen drag from stranding the
    // ghost anywhere.
    //
    // Rejected: constraining the drag AXIS (a reorder drag is vertical, i.e.
    // the same axis as the scroll — it separates nothing), and moving the
    // drag source onto a grip handle (see the gutter above: 22 x 50 leaves no
    // room beside the two chevrons, and the chevrons already are the non-drag
