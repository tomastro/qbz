// THE shared album card — QML replica of discover/AlbumCard.slint, used
// by BOTH the Home rails and the Library All grid (the Slint mounts the
// same component in both places).
//
// 200x246: 200px artwork (Radius.sm) + placeholder, hover scrim with
// genre/year meta, Quick View + pin group (top-right), favorite / play / more
// overlay buttons, award ribbon, source badge (opt-in), then the title/artist
// lines with the icon-only quality badge.

//   Open album · Play · Play next · Play later · Add to queue ·
//   Add to/Remove from Library (show-favorite) ·
//   Add to playlist · Add to mixtape · Make available offline (catalog, not
//     pulled — QoL round + 2026-08-31 additions over the .slint inventory) ·
//   Block this album (source != local && source != plex)
// (the first entry's NOUN is overridable per host — see `openLabel`; the last
//  two are gated on `catalogAffordances`)
// …plus whatever the host appends through `extraMenuEntries` (My QBZ's
// "Remove from collection" — see that property).
// All but the last are live. "Block this album" is gated OFF by
// `hasBlacklistSeam` below: the Qt bridge exposes the blacklist COUNTERS
// (settings_qt/devtools.rs) but no block-album invokable, and the row used
