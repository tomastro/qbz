    // disagree with Slint about.
    //
    // This was the title-truncation bug: at the old hardcoded 1280 the
    // now-playing bar sat one responsive tier below the Slint build on the same
    // machine (1280 < 1366 -> side fraction 0.39 instead of 0.30), so the
    // Classic song card received ~446px instead of the larger mid-tier runway
    // and elided titles early. The tier thresholds were right; the window was
    // the wrong size. The card now also measures its live neighbouring controls,
    // so restored geometry and in-bar allocation solve different parts of the
    // same problem rather than relying on a fixed card cap.
    //
    // These stay plain bindings so the size is correct before the window maps.
    // The WM's own resizes write `width`/`height` from C++ — that does not
    // disturb the binding, and nothing ever re-sets the bridge properties, so
    // the value never snaps back under the user.
    //
    // Slint's best-effort monitor clamp (main.rs:8242-8249) is folded INTO the
    // binding rather than applied afterwards: a size saved on the big display
    // must not strand the window on a smaller one, and the clamped number has
    // to be the MAPPED number. Done imperatively in Component.onCompleted (as
    // it was) it ran after componentComplete had already shown the window, so
    // the window flashed at the oversized geometry and then snapped — and the

    //
    // The macOS arm is FIRST-CLASS QT API (6.9+, and both machines run
    // 6.11.1), not a hand-rolled AppKit poke: `ExpandedClientAreaHint`
    // expands the client area into the region the titlebar controls occupy,
    // `NoTitleBarBackgroundHint` drops the titlebar's background — and the
    // native traffic lights STAY. Content then reaches y=0 and the QBZ header
    // sits under them.
    //
    // The previous attempt set `titlebarAppearsTransparent` +
    // `titleVisibility` + `NSWindowStyleMaskFullSizeContentView` on the
    // NSWindow from Rust, and could not win: `QCocoaWindow::windowStyleMask()`
    // RECOMPUTES the mask from Qt's own flags and reassigns it on
    // `setWindowFlags()`, on fullscreen enter/exit, and via `setWindowState()`
    // — preserving only the fullscreen and unified-toolbar bits, never
    // FullSizeContentView. The `visibility` binding below is itself a
    // `setWindowState()`, so the bit was wiped moments after being set. That
    // is why the log kept saying "traffic lights centred" while the owner kept
    // seeing a stock title bar. (Qt forum "Unable to get transparent title bar
    // in macOS since Qt 6.4", QTBUG-134797.)
    //
    // Frameless is NOT an option on macOS: it removes the traffic lights with
    // the frame, and the reference never draws its own there
    // ("Linux only — macOS keeps the native traffic lights",
    // WindowControls.slint:1-2).
    // WINDOWS takes the macOS shape, not the Linux one, and the difference is
    // the whole feature (W27).
    //
    // `Qt.FramelessWindowHint` removes WS_THICKFRAME, and THAT is what the
    // shell keys tiling on: Win+Arrow and Aero Snap by dragging to an edge both
    // stop, along with the DWM drop shadow and the Win11 rounded corners. So
    // "hide title bar" was not making the app refuse the shortcuts -- it had
    // stopped being a window the shell could tile.
    //
    // NOT restored, and it cannot be from flags alone: the Windows 11 Snap
    // Layouts flyout that appears when hovering a maximise button. Windows asks
    // for it by hit-testing that pixel as HTMAXBUTTON, and QBZ's maximise
    // button is a QML item inside the client area, so it answers HTCLIENT.
    // Wiring it would mean reporting HTMAXBUTTON over that one rect from the
    // native filter -- deliberate future work, not something this arm does.
    //
    // Qt 6.9's Windows plugin already implements WM_NCCALCSIZE -> 0,
    // DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea, the eight resize edges and
    // safeAreaMargins() for `ExpandedClientAreaHint` -- the same flags the
    // macOS arm uses. `CustomizeWindowHint` with no button hints then
    // suppresses Qt's own painted title cluster
    // (qwindowswindow.cpp :3561/:3600/:3624/:3645) while the window KEEPS
    // WS_CAPTION, so the shell still treats it as tileable.
    //
    // It also provides no HTCAPTION drag band of its own (:3332-3338: with
    // both isDefaultTitleBar and isCustomized false the whole title block is
    // skipped), which is why HeaderBar's QML `startSystemMove()` stays: it
    // issues SC_MOVE, and SC_MOVE drags DO snap. The eight QML resize grips
    // stay enabled too and do not fight the native edges -- Qt answers
    // WM_NCHITTEST first, so a press on the border never reaches QML.

    // visibility, and the transient states persist nothing at all.

    // THE INVARIANT (§5.8.1, §13-D18, AC-24, stage-0 S0-4): the main window is
    // hidden and shown ONLY by these two functions, and they are the ONLY
    // callers of QbzTray.setWindowShown. The reference has a real desync
    // exactly here — the miniplayer's enter()/exit() call m.hide()/m.show()
    // directly (crates/qbz/src/miniplayer.rs:186, :207) instead of
    // tray::hide_window/show_window, so WINDOW_SHOWN goes stale and, while the
    // mini is up, the first tray left-click hides an already-hidden window and
    // the second brings the MAIN window back beside the live mini (#559/#618).
    // A bare window.hide()/window.show() anywhere in this file re-opens that
    // hole; the miniplayer handler below calls these verbs for that reason.
    //
    // ⚠ ONE WRITER THE S0-4 GREP CANNOT SEE, named here so a green grep is not
    // read as more than it proves: the drawn MINIMIZE buttons call
    // `hostWindow.showMinimized()` (shell/HeaderBar.qml, shell/KioskShell.qml)
    // and deliberately do NOT report. That is correct — a minimized window is
    // still SHOWN, not hidden-to-tray, and owner ruling K5 keeps that button an
    // unconditional WM minimize. The consequence is real and inherited from the
    // reference, which tracks the same flag the same way: with the window
    // ICONIFIED, `WINDOW_SHOWN` is still true, so the next tray left-click
    // takes the hide arm rather than restoring. `showFromTray()` below at least
    // un-iconifies, so the SECOND click genuinely brings it back.
    // The un-hide POSITION (owner report 2026-08-31). Qt keeps the window's
    // SIZE across hide()/show(), but a remap is a fresh mapping to the WM and
    // KWin's placement policy re-places it (observed: horizontally centred).
    // The persisted geometry cannot help — saveWindowGeometry carries only
    // width/height + flags, no x/y — so the position is captured at the hide
    // and re-applied around the show. Session-local on purpose: across
    // launches the WM's placement remains the authority, this only makes
    // hide -> restore a round trip. On Wayland the x/y writes are no-ops and
