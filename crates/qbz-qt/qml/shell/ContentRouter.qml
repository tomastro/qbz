    // SYNCHRONOUS — and the reasoning for the failed experiment is kept here so
    // nobody re-runs it.
    //
    // The dead-click complaint ("nothing is happening after the click… ah, it
    // WAS loading, I thought it had died") is real: a route change instantiates
    // the whole view on the UI thread before anything can paint. `asynchronous:
    // true` plus a router-level placeholder looked like the answer, and it made
    // the app MUCH worse — the owner's words were "como si mi conexión fuera de
    // 56kbps" and "nos regresó 10 años atrás".
    //
    // WHY it was worse, because this is the part that is not obvious: async
    // incubation is TIME-SLICED. It yields to the UI thread between slices, so
    // it trades a short freeze for a much longer wall-clock build, and the
    // Loader stays in `Loading` until the ENTIRE tree exists — for Discover >
    // Home that means all 413 cards. A 1s freeze became a five-second skeleton.
    // On a top-level tab the user expects to be instant, that trade is simply
    // the wrong one.
    //
    // WHAT THE REAL FIX TURNED OUT TO BE — and this paragraph used to say the
    // opposite, so read it before acting on a memory of it. It claimed the
    // answer was to "keep the top-level tabs alive across navigation". That is
    // wrong, and it was wrong on the evidence available at the time: BOTH
    // references destroy and re-create the view exactly like this Loader does.
    // Slint gates every view on `if NavState.view == ...` (AppShell.slint:426),
    // which destroys the element tree; Tauri used `{#if activeView === 'home'}`
    // (+page.svelte:6286), which removes it from the DOM — and Tauri even
    // REFETCHES from the network on mount and still transitions instantly.
    // Neither gets its speed from caching the view.
    //
    // What they both do is keep the MOUNT proportional to one viewport, and
    // that is where this port had diverged. Measured 2026-08-17 by driving the
    // real app (`QBZ_QT_NAV_BENCH`, the probe below, and a frame-by-frame read
    // of a screen recording): a click on Discover froze the UI thread for
    // 1.52 s — not slow, FROZEN, zero pixels changing anywhere in the window —
    // where the Slint build painted the same page, artwork included, in a
    // single frame. Inside that time HomeView was building all FOUR of its
    // Discover tabs, because `visible: false` hides an item and does not stop
    // QML from instantiating it, so 19 of 28 section rails belonged to tabs
    // nobody was looking at. Slint runs ONE repeater whose model is chosen by
    // a ternary (HomeView.slint:321) and mounts the rest behind `if`.
    //
    // So the rule is about the SIZE of a mount, not its lifetime: a view may
    // be rebuilt freely as long as it only builds what is on screen. That rule
    // is now enforced statically — qml_eager_tab_audit.py runs in qt-run.sh
    // and fails the build on a heavy per-tab body gated only by `visible:`.
    // Synchronous stays, and is correct — what changed on 2026-08-21 is
    // WHEN it runs, not how. See THE TWO-PHASE ROUTE COMMIT below.

    // Route-change stopwatch. OFF by default (a LoggingCategory at Warning
    // emits nothing at Info), so the only cost on a normal run is one
    // Date.now() per route change. Turn it on with:
    //
    //     QT_LOGGING_RULES="qbz.nav.timing.info=true" ./target/release/qbz
    //
    // It answers the question no static gate can: of the wall-clock between

    // versus everything the event loop still owes afterwards (`to-idle`).

    // ── THE TWO-PHASE ROUTE COMMIT (the dead click) ────────────────────────
    //
    // MEASURED 2026-08-21, by driving the real app under Xvfb and diffing the
    // captured frames: a click on Discover > Home left the window showing the
    // OLD page — flyout still open, not one pixel changing anywhere — for
    // 590 ms. The route change is synchronous (read the Loader's header above, which
    // is still correct), so the click handler, the flyout close, the sidebar
    // highlight, the page blank AND the whole mount all happened inside ONE
    // turn of the event loop, and the first frame that could be presented was
    // the one that already had the new page in it. Nothing the user did was
    // acknowledged until everything was finished.
    //
    // The breakdown of that 590 ms is worth keeping, because only ONE of the
    // three parts is what it looks like:
    //     navigate_to (Rust, on the GUI thread)     7.6 ms
    //     bridge queue hop                          1   ms
    //     the QML mount (`built`)                 263   ms
    //     post-mount work before the first frame  ~290  ms   <-- `to-idle`
    // `built` is under half of it. The other half is everything the mount
    // DEFERS — layout and the first delegate refills — which the GUI thread
    // pays before it can reach the event loop again and let a frame out. So
    // `to-idle`, not `built`, is the number that matches the freeze.
    //
    // THE SPLIT: arm on the route change, commit on the next PRESENTED frame.
    // Frame N carries the cheap half — flyout gone, nav highlight moved, page
    // blanked — and only then does frame N+1 pay for the mount. The click is
    // acknowledged in one frame instead of in `to-idle`.
    //
    // `frameSwapped` and not a zero-interval Timer: the timer fires on the
    // next event-loop iteration, which is NOT the same thing as "after a frame
    // reached the screen" — the render pass is scheduled through the event
    // loop too, so a Timer can easily win the race and put the mount back in
    // the same frame, which is the bug. `frameSwapped` is emitted after the
    // buffer swap (verified against this Qt build with a standalone scene),
    // and its queued delivery lands the handler on the GUI thread.
    //
    // Cost: ONE frame (~16 ms) of added latency to the content, in exchange
    // for the whole `to-idle` window becoming visibly alive.

    // GPU doctrine (qt-frontend/2026-08-11-scenegraph-batches §9) forbids
    // CONTINUOUS animation off the shared pulse, because each dirty frame
    // presents the whole window at ~1.2% GPU. This one is bounded and
    // user-initiated: one navigation buys ~18 presents at 60 Hz, and at rest
    // it writes NOTHING (the Animator is stopped and opacity is a flat 1).
    //
    // 300 ms. The contract's first proposal was 120-150 ms; at 140 the owner
    // could not see it at all. Part of that was the duration and part was a
    // real defect (see the note on WHAT fades, below) — 300 fixes the half
    // that is duration, and is still one bounded animation per navigation.

    // WHAT FADES, and why this is the page and not a veil over it.
    //
    // The first cut of this faded a Rectangle laid over the content, coloured
    // from the pane it sits in. That is wrong here, and invisibly so: AppShell
    // paints the pane `surface-main` normally but `surface-main @ 0.22` while
    // the ambient background is on (AppShell.qml:324, QbzTheme.qml:38), and the
    // ambient background is on whenever a track is loaded (QbzTheme.qml:132).
    // So in the configuration the app actually runs in, a veil at FULL opacity
    // covered 22% of the page and the fade read as a flicker. Fading the page
    // itself has no such failure mode, needs no colour at all, and keeps the
    // ambient art visible underneath — which a veil opaque enough to work would
    // have blacked out for the length of the fade.
    //
    // No `layer.enabled`: group opacity would cost an FBO the size of the
    // content pane, allocated at the exact moment the mount is already the most
    // expensive thing on screen. Per-node alpha lets overlapping children show
    // through each other, which is the honest trade — and at 300 ms on a page
    // that is arriving rather than sitting still, it is not visible.
    //
    // reduceMotion (shell_bridge.rs:217) skips the whole thing: the page simply
    // appears, which is the behaviour before this block existed.

    // Watchdog. `onLoaded` is the only thing that brings the page back, and an
    // invisible content pane is the worst failure this file can produce, so a
    // missed signal (a view that fails to instantiate, a source that resolves
    // to nothing) must not be able to leave it at zero.
