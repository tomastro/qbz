// App shell — the QML port of crates/qbz-ui/ui/shell/AppShell.slint's
// chrome: HeaderBar (top, 42px) / { Sidebar | content frame | queue
// column } / NowPlayingBarSmall (bottom).
//
// The window chrome is surface-card throughout; the content area is a
// ROUNDED surface-main panel inset 8px left/right/bottom (0 top — it
// butts the header), the "Slack-style bezel on all four corners" of
// AppShell.slint:358-390. The recovery affordance and logout live in the
// header (offline badge flyout + app menu), like the Slint shell.
//
// The artwork-derived ambient background IS implemented, in BOTH of the
// reference's modes (AppShell.slint:206-242): 1 = Ambient, the album-triad
// metaball field (AmbientField) under a tunable dark scrim; 2 = Blurred art,
// the ImmersiveAtmosphere cover look, which carries its own `dim` and takes no
// scrim. `theme.ambientOn` says "a mode is picked and a track is loaded";
// `QbzShell.ambientMode` says WHICH. Until 2026-08-11 mode 2 rendered as mode 1
// (ambient_qt.rs said so out loud), so the two settings looked identical.
//
// THE LAYERING, which is the part that has to be exact. Three tiers, not one:
//   chrome  (Sidebar / HeaderBar / NPB / queue column / the CONTENT FRAME)
//           -> surface-card @ 0.5
//   panel   (the inset content pane) -> surface-main @ 0.22 + a 1px hairline,
//           composited ON TOP OF the frame, because in the reference it is the
//           frame's CHILD (AppShell.slint:358-414)
//   views   -> transparent, with their thin bars at surface-main @ 0.3 and
//           their controls at surface-elevated @ 0.5
// The frame tier was missing here: `contentFrame` was a sibling of the shell
// root, so the 8px gutter around the pane showed the RAW field instead of
// card @ 0.5, and the pane composited over the raw field too. Measured on the
// owner's side-by-side: Qt's sidebar (27,28,34) against its gutter (50,52,64) —
// a bright seam at x=240 — where Slint's sidebar (79,72,23) and gutter
// (82,74,20) are the same surface and read as one continuous frame.

    // paints opaquely at the frame's corners paints straight over the bezel
    // and the panel reads square. Slint has no such split: its `clip: true`
    // on a Rectangle clips to the ROUNDED shape (AppShell.slint:409-414 sets
    // border-radius + clip on the same element and the album atmosphere
    // inside it is cut by the arc), which is why the identical structure is
    // correct there and wrong here. The visible offender is the album/artist
    // header band (controls/HeaderGradient.qml, full-bleed at y:0), but the
    // defect is the frame's, not the band's: the band scrolls, so rounding
    // the band itself would only hold at scroll offset 0 — measured, the
    // corners go square again the moment the page scrolls and the band's body
    // reaches the top edge. The mask therefore belongs here, once, and it
    // covers every present and future view.
    //
    // SIBLINGS of the pane, not children of it. Inside it they sat
    // at z:0 with the view Loader, so any overlay a VIEW mounts painted over
    // them and the corners read square while it was open — the pane-filling
    // modals are exactly that: DiscoverConfigModal z:3100 (HomeView:1130),
    // GenreFilterPopup z:3000 (Home/Library/DiscoverBrowse/PlaylistBrowse),
    // TrackInfoModal z:3000 (rows/TrackRow.qml:565, and TrackRow mounts
    // inside views). Raising the nubs to z:3200 would only win until the next
    // modal, because ADR-009 fixes in-pane modals at z >= 3000 and says
    // nothing about a ceiling. Out here the question does not arise: the mask
    // describes the FRAME's silhouette, so nothing the frame contains can
    // reach it, whatever z it picks. Window-level overlays declared after
    // this block still paint over the nubs — Cortinilla, the shared text
    // modal, the drag ghost, ArtPreviewOverlay — and that is correct: a
    // window-wide scrim covers the pane corners too. SidebarNowPlayingDock is
    // also later but lives inside the 240px sidebar (x:16, w:208) and never
    // touches the frame.
    //
    // Mechanism: four small Canvas nubs, each filling its corner square with
    // the shell colour and punching the quarter-disc back out.
    //
    // DOCTRINE CORRECTION (2026-07-29). This paragraph used to justify the
    // Canvas by claiming "ShaderEffect / OpacityMask render NOTHING on the
    // software path, and `layer.enabled` would cost an FBO every frame".
    // Both halves are FALSE as stated: effects need shaders, and this port
    // runs on the GPU (OpenGL RHI, measured via QSG_INFO 2026-07-29) — the
    // "renders nothing" note came from an offscreen session, which forces the
    // software renderer by definition. A `layer` FBO is also rendered once and
    // CACHED for static content, not re-rendered per frame. Where a software
    // path is genuinely possible, detect it with `GraphicsInfo.api` rather
    // than assuming it (theme/RoundedImage.qml does exactly that and is the
    // canonical statement of this rule — read its "HOW THE ROUNDING IS DONE"
    // header before touching any masking code).
    //
    // The Canvas here is still the right call, but on its own merits, not that
    // one: the nubs are 4 x 12x12 px rastered ONCE and repainted only when the
    // theme colour or the radius changes, whereas masking the frame would mean
    // an FBO the size of the whole content pane, re-rendered on every window
    // resize and invalidated by anything animating inside the pane.
    //
    // The fill is `contentFrame.color` because that is literally what shows
    // through the bezel — the frame IS the 8px gutter, and with the background
    // off it is surface-card, the same colour as the HeaderBar above and the
    // NPB gap below. (It was `root.color` before the frame existed; identical
    // value, but now it tracks the surface it is actually cutting into rather
    // than one that happens to match.)
    //
    // Gated on the ambient background being OFF, and that is not a
    // shortcut: with the dynamic background active the pane goes
    // translucent (surface-main @ 0.22 + hairline) and the field
    // is SUPPOSED to show through the corners, so an opaque nub would be
    // the regression. The same flag also suppresses the album/artist
    // atmosphere (AlbumView.qml:71 `headerAtmoOn = pref && !ambientOn`,
    // AlbumPageView.slint:168) — the two states are complementary, never
    // both.
    //
    // WHAT COVERS THE AMBIENT-ON CASE, since this block cannot: nothing that
    // paints opaquely may reach the frame's corners while the field is
    // showing through them, and by construction almost nothing does — every
    // view root goes `color: "transparent"` under ambient (HomeView.qml:53 and
    // its twelve siblings), and the ones that stay opaque round their own fill
    // (`radius: 12`, the same trick, applied by the offender instead of by a
    // mask). Sweeping the pane-level overlay set (ADR-009's z >= 3000) turned
    // up ONE that did neither: controls/DiscoverConfigModal.qml's scrim, a
    // full-bleed #bf000000 Rectangle at z:3100.
    // It now carries `radius: theme.radiusMd` too. GenreFilterPopup's backdrop
    // is a bare MouseArea (paints nothing) and TrackInfoModal / CastPicker are
    // parented to the window Overlay, where covering the pane corners is the
    // correct behaviour. A future full-bleed opaque pane child must round
    // itself the same way — there is no mask that can do it for it here.
    // Positions are the PANE's rect in shell coordinates. The pane is a child
    // of the frame now, so its own x/y are frame-local (8, 0) and have to be
    // offset by the frame's origin — reading contentPane.x directly here would
    // put every nub 8px to the left of the corner it is meant to cut.
