// Left navigation sidebar — QML port of crates/qbz-ui/ui/shell/Sidebar.slint.
//
// Three states (ShellState.sidebar-state): 0 = open 240px (icon + label),
// 1 = mini (icons only), 2 = closed 0px. Width animates 160ms ease-in-out;
// the header's panel-left button cycles (QbzShell.cycleSidebar).
//
// MINI RAIL: 64px, 1:1 with Slint (state.slint:4075), holding a 34px row
// (Sidebar.slint:575/652) on symmetric 15px padding. It was 50px for a while —
// an owner deviation that turned out to put the rail's centre 5px left of the
// header control sitting directly above it; see `miniPadLeft` below and
// QbzTheme.sidebarMiniWidth for the measurement. Everything else
// in the mini state is 1:1 with Slint: rows centre their lone glyph, nested
// playlist rows collapse to zero, hovering a row names it in a bubble to the
// right (SidebarTooltip.slint) and clicking a FOLDER opens its playlists in a
// flyout to the right (SidebarFolderPopup.slint) — in mini a folder cannot
// expand in place, so a toggle there would be a control that does nothing.
//
// FILE LENGTH (>500): what remains after the mini folder flyout moved to
// shell/SidebarFolderFlyout.qml and the row context menu to
// shell/SidebarRowMenu.qml is ONE surface with one state machine — the three
// sidebar widths. Every block below is a WIDTH-CONDITIONAL variant of the same
// tree (the nav rows, the PLAYLISTS toolbar, the row delegate and the
// scrollbar each read `root.mini`), so splitting them into files would hand
// each half a `mini` property to keep in sync and put the row delegate's
// drop-target arithmetic — which needs `root`'s own window coordinates — a
// file away from the root it measures. The three things that DID come out are
// the three that are self-contained: both overlays and the hover bubble (the
// shell's shared QbzTooltip). All three are shared single instances declared
// at this root, never one per row: the tree can hold hundreds of rows.
//
// Top-level section nav rows (Discover / Library / Local Library / My QBZ)
// replicate SidebarNavRow: 34px rows, radius 6, 16px icons, 13px/w500
// labels, surface-hover on hover, Discover + Library HIDDEN while offline
// (ADR-010 mount-site gating). The whole block — rows AND the hairline under
// them — is mounted only while `QbzShell.navInSidebar` is ON; with it OFF the
// sections move to the header (HeaderBar.qml) and this sidebar starts at the
// PLAYLISTS toolbar, exactly like Sidebar.slint:724/817.
//
// The rows open the same dropdown FLYOUT their Slint counterparts do
// (SidebarNavRow: hover or click, panel to the RIGHT of the row, headed by
// the section name) — the panel, its behaviour and the entry catalog live in
// the shared NavFlyout.qml, which HeaderBar.qml mounts too, so the sections
// behave identically wherever the nav is hosted. The rows keep the
// SidebarDirectRow active treatment (surface-hover bg + primary text/icon)
// for the current section and while their own menu is open.
// All four sections route into real views, My QBZ included (its Collections /
// Mixtapes entries reach the "collections" / "mixtapes" routes). The disabled
// treatment the NavRow still carries — dimmed to 0.45, pointer-inert, no
// flyout — is the mechanism for a section with no surface behind it, and
// nothing uses it today (a row that clicks into nothing is a defect, not a
// stub). Its leading glyph goes through shell/NavSectionGlyph.qml, because My
// QBZ can carry a user-supplied icon (SidebarNavRow `raw-icon`).
// PURCHASES is the one row in that block that is NOT a section: it is a
// DirectRow (SidebarDirectRow) — no dropdown, no catalog entry, it just
// navigates — and it is triple-gated (opt-in `show_purchases`, hidden while
// offline, and relocated to the custom title bar by `nav_tb_purchases`).
// Both prefs default OFF, so on a stock install this block is still the same
// four section rows it has always been.
// The playlist/folder tree below the nav IS live (sidebar_qt.rs: load, sort,
// search, expand/collapse, drag-drop target), and so is everything the "..."
// menu offers: New folder opens QbzFolderEdit's create panel (the small
// name-only create modal, controls/FolderModals.qml), Manage playlists routes
// to the Playlist Manager, Import opens the importer and Refresh rebuilds the
// tree. Import is the only row that dims — it is the only Qobuz-only one, so it
// follows the reference's `enabled: !offline`; Refresh stays lit because its
// bridge call is the offline-safe rebuild (see the Repeater's comment). Nothing
// in this file renders a control that no-ops.
//
// Right-pressing a row opens shell/SidebarRowMenu.qml (edit / hide / mixtape /
// move-to-folder). It is suppressed on the mini rail: Slint anchors that menu
// at `row.width - 210px`, which on a 34px rail row is deeply negative and Qt's
// viewport clamp would drop it at x=8 — not the reference's placement, just
// the clamp.

    //
    //  1. THE OLD ONE WAS BROKEN. It was a QtQuick.Controls `ToolTip` with a
    //     custom contentItem, and a ToolTip does not propagate a custom
    //     content's implicit size: measured on Qt 6.11.1, an identical Text
    //     inside a `Popup` gives implicitContentWidth 157.8 and inside a
    //     `ToolTip` gives 1. The Basic style then sizes the popup to
    //     `implicitContentWidth + padding`, so the bubble collapsed to ~13x25
    //     while the Text — which a Popup never clips — kept painting its full
    //     178px: the label floated over the content pane with no background and
    //     a small detached box sat beside it (owner report, reproduced and
    //     pixel-sampled before the change).
    //  2. Slint does not put a popup per call site either. It has ONE overlay
    //     fed by a global channel (SidebarTooltipState, state.slint:1893;
    //     TooltipState, state.slint:4791), precisely so a clipped surface — and
    //     this sidebar clips — can still show a bubble outside its own bounds.

    // Folder flyout (mini rail) and the row context menu — ONE shared instance
    // each, declared at this root, never one per delegate: the tree can hold
    // hundreds of rows. Both are Popups, so their content is reparented to the

            // third scrollbar implementation. Two accepted deviations from
            // the sidebar's bespoke Slint one: it reveals on SCROLL (900ms
            // auto-hide) instead of on row-hover, and its thumb is the
            // standard 8/10px instead of the sidebar's thinner 3-6px.
            // Placed in the sidebar's right PADDING (negative margin), like
            // Slint's `x: parent.width - width + (mini ? 8 : Spacing.md)`, so
            // the gutter never overlays the rows and cannot eat their clicks.
            //
            // MINI CAVEAT after the optical re-centring above: the right pad is
            // 4px now, so an 8px gutter pinned to the rail's edge shares its
            // left 4px with the rows. That is fine to LOOK at (an 8px-wide,
            // auto-hiding indicator whose thumb grazes the pill's rounded right
            // edge) but not to CLICK through, so the mini instance is
            // `enabled: false`: indicator only, no drag / click-to-position.
            // Nothing is lost — the wheel scrolls the rail, and a 3px-of-travel
            // drag inside a 50px rail was never a real affordance. The open
            // sidebar keeps the full interactive bar.
