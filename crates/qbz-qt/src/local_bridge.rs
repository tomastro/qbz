//! QbzLocal — the Local Library domain bridge (the phase-23 per-domain
//! pattern, modelled on `home_bridge.rs`: ONE `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` mod, ONE
//! `#[qml_element] #[qml_singleton]` QObject, its own
//! `OnceLock<CxxQtThread>`, a `boot()` invokable and a `pub(crate) fn ui()`).
//!
//! Every property is ONE JSON document (the `library_qt.rs` transport
//! rationale): the QML view parses it once per publish and derives its
//! search / sort / grouping in JS. Artwork never rides the document — it is
//! id-keyed through `localArtworkReady`, windowed by the grid/list, and
//! evicted QML-side, which is what keeps a 16K-track library from decoding
//! covers it never shows.
//!
//! The invokables stay one-line forwards into the `local_*` modules; the
//! blocking DB work runs on `spawn_blocking` so the Qt event loop is never
//! touched by a rusqlite call, and the Plex network work runs on the tokio
//! runtime.
