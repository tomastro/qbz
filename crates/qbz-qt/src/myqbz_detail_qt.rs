//! My QBZ — collection / mixtape DETAIL controller. The Qt port of
//! `crates/qbz/src/myqbz_detail.rs` (spec 02 §6.2), publishing ONE JSON
//! document (`QbzMyQbz.detailJson`, spec 02 §5.2).
//!
//! Shape follows `playlist_qt.rs`: a module-level `Mutex` document + a cached
//! full item list backing a client-side filter -> search -> sort that
//! re-derives the visible rows. The Slint uses `thread_local!` because its
//! caches hold `!Send` `slint::Image`s; Qt documents are plain JSON, so the
//! caches are plain statics reachable from the tokio tasks with no GUI hop.
//!
//! Load order (spec 02 §6.2 `navigate`): `reset()` (clears the three caches +
//! the prefs gate, publishes `{loading:true, found:true}`) -> BLOCK fetch (the
//! collection AND its persisted accordion set, one `spawn_blocking`) ->
//! `apply()` (header -> hero mosaic -> restore view-prefs -> open the persist
//! gate -> restore the pruned open set -> FULL_ITEMS -> rebuild) -> ONE artwork
//! pass + ONE republish -> `resolve_items` (fire-and-forget, <= 6 concurrent)
//! -> `ensure_expanded` (a no-op unless the restored set opened something).
//!
//! Two divergences from the reference are REPRODUCED on purpose and must not
//! be "unified" (spec 02 §6.2 + review items 23/26):
//! - the hero mosaic's custom-cover predicate is a bare `is_some()`, while the
//!   header's `hasCustomCover` also requires the file to resolve. A collection
//!   whose stored cover file was deleted therefore shows the kind glyph in the
//!   hero and the full mosaic in the GRID.
//! - a RESOLVED album row's `typeLabel` is UNTRANSLATED (`classify_release_type`
//!   returns the marked English literal and the reference never wraps it in
//!   `t()`), while an unresolved one reads the translated `t("ALBUM")`.
//!
//! Offline loads use the active cache index both to hide unavailable entries
//! and to hydrate cached Qobuz quality/type badges without calling the API.
