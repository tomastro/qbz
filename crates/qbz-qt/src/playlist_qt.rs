//! Playlist detail controller — the QML port of the Slint PlaylistView
//! surface (crates/qbz/src/playlist.rs load + the PlaylistActions glue in
//! main.rs). Publishes ONE JSON document (`playlistJson`).
//!
//! Wired:
//! - load: `get_playlist` (full track list inline) + header mapping
//!   (the playlist's OWN `image_rectangle` graphic else the member-cover
//!   mosaic urls, owner/count/total duration, HTML-stripped description +
//!   word-boundary 160-char short).
//! - play all / shuffle (the playlist track list as the queue).
//! - favorite toggle (owned), follow/unfollow (foreign, subscribe API,
//!   optimistic flip + revert), copy-to-library (create + add all ids),
//!   pin (shared pinned store), rename (`update_playlist`), delete
//!   (`delete_playlist` + nav back).
//! - in-playlist search filter + sort (default/title/artist/album/
//!   duration/added/custom), "custom" = the drag order.
//! - per-row Remove from playlist (owner) via `remove_tracks_from_playlist`
//!   (the playlist's own track-row ids).
//! - drag reorder (issue #589): visible-index move + persistence of the
//!   custom order.
//!
//! LOCAL playlists are NOT out of scope any more (that POC-NOTE was stale and
//! it had already misled one call site into stamping `"source": "qobuz"` on
//! every row): `local_playlist_qt::load` resolves a `local:<uuid>` detail and
//! publishes it THROUGH THIS DOCUMENT via [`adopt_doc`]. Consequences for
//! anyone reading a row here:
//! - `PlaylistDoc.is_local_playlist` says which kind is on screen.
//! - `PlaylistTrackRow.source` is `""` (Qobuz) | `"local"` | `"plex"`, and
//!   `id` lives in a DIFFERENT id space per source. Never read a row's `id`
//!   as a catalog id without checking `source` first — that is the
//!   id-confusion class `playlist_picker_qt.rs`'s header exists to prevent.
//! - `unavailable` rows carry a ref that cannot resolve at all; they render
//!   honestly and every "copy this track somewhere" affordance must be absent
//!   on them. `notStreamable` is a DIFFERENT thing and lives beside it: Qobuz
//!   pulled the recording. That one can heal, it is the only one the
//!   replacement search can act on, and a row carrying it plus
//!   `cacheStatus == 3` is not dead at all — it plays from the download.
//!
//! Known parity deltas:
//! - The custom drag order persists to a per-user `playlist_orders.json`
//!   in the user dir (the Slint uses `playlist_orders.db` with
//!   `(u64, bool, i32)` rows — same behavior, simpler backend for the POC).
//! - Suggested Songs are not ported.
//! - Custom covers, multi-select/bulk actions and public-link sharing are live.
//!   Copying a foreign playlist still does not clone its source artwork into a
//!   new custom-cover override.
