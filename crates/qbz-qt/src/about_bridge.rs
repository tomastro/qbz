//! QbzAbout — the About QBZ + What's New bridge.
//!
//! Two documents and four invokables. The controllers are `about_qt.rs` and
//! `whats_new_qt.rs`; this file is glue and nothing else, exactly like
//! `musician_bridge.rs`.
//!
//! # Why a NEW bridge instead of more members on QbzShell
//!
//! `QbzShell` is already the port's 1200-line catch-all and several lanes edit
//! it at once. This port has 23 bridges and a small domain object is the normal
//! shape, so About/What's New gets its own rather than widening the shared
//! file. External links are the one thing that does NOT move here:
//! `QbzShell.openExternalUrl` (`shell_bridge.rs:440` / `:1202`) already exists
//! and both modals call it — a second opener would be a second thing to keep
//! in sync.
//!
//! # A new bridge is SEVEN artefacts, not one file
//!
//! This file · its `build.rs` `rust_files` entry · the `main.rs` `mod` line ·
//! the QML singleton registration (which IS the build.rs entry) · the two
//! modal mounts in `AppShell.qml` · the two `HeaderBar.qml` rows. A bridge
//! missing from `build.rs` does not fail the build: its QML singleton simply
//! does not exist and every `QbzAbout.foo()` becomes a runtime ReferenceError
//! `cargo check` cannot see. `qml_singleton_xref.py` is the gate for that.
//!
//! # The Qt-thread hop registers ITSELF
//!
//! Every other domain singleton is booted from `Main.qml`'s `boot()` sweep.
//! [`QbzAbout::boot`] exists and does the same job, but the four invokables
//! ALSO register the hop on first use, because both modals are opened by a
//! user action long after startup and nothing here publishes before that. That
//! makes this bridge work whether or not the (integration-owned) `Main.qml`
//! sweep ever gains its line — a bridge whose publishes silently no-op because
//! one QML line is missing is exactly the class of failure `cargo check`
//! cannot see.
