//! Local-library half of the search cortinilla — the on-device sections.
//!
//! Port of the local arms of `qbz/src/search.rs` (`LocalCaps`,
//! `local_artwork_url`, `local_album_artist`, `derive_local_album_rows`,
//! `derive_local_artist_rows`, `map_local_track_to_cort_row`,
//! `append_local_sections`, `load_cortinilla_local`), per the 2026-08-03
//! cortinilla-parity contract §1.3 / §2.
//!
//! It lives in its own module for two reasons. `search_qt.rs` already hosts
//! three controllers and is well past the TRACK-RULES §2 size budget, and both
//! the desktop and the immersive dropdowns need these mappers — the immersive
//! arm shipped first with its own copies, and those copies MOVED here rather
//! than being duplicated (§5: reuse over duplicate).
//!
//! Pure + blocking helpers only: no Qt types, no bridge, no `ui()`. The
//! publishing side stays in `search_qt.rs`.
//!
//! ## What the reference does that this does NOT change
//!
//! Several oddities are reproduced 1:1 on purpose, because the reference is
//! the spec and a "fix" here would be a silent divergence:
//!
//! - **No dedupe between the Qobuz half and the local half.** An album owned
//!   locally AND in the catalog appears twice, in two sections, with two ids.
//! - **`has_more` is window-relative, not library-relative.** No `COUNT(*)` is
//!   ever issued; it answers "were there more distinct groups inside the rows
//!   I fetched", which under-reports on a large library.
//! - **Plex rows are PREPENDED and the track section is a plain `take(cap)`,**
//!   so three Plex matches can starve the local-file tracks out of the section
//!   entirely.
//! - **Artwork is resolved before mapping.** Current scans persist
//!   embedded/disc/collection art in that order; this bounded search window
//!   also runs the queue-time folder resolver so rows indexed by an older
//!   build get the same per-disc result without requiring a rescan.
