//! Rust-side navigation history — the POC counterpart of Slint's
//! `NavState.can-back` / `can-forward` / request-back / request-forward.
//!
//! A simple stack (Vec + index): `record(view)` pushes a view (truncating
//! any forward entries), `back()` / `forward()` move the cursor. Every
//! mutation republishes `canBack` / `canForward` / `currentView` onto the
//! bridge.
//!
//! There is NO route table here, and that is deliberate: a view id is an
//! opaque `String`, and the only place the set of legal ids is enumerated is
//! `qml/shell/ContentRouter.qml`'s content `Loader` chain. (It used to live in
//! `AppShell.qml`; the kiosk port extracted it so BOTH shells share one chain,
//! and this paragraph said "AppShell" for far too long afterwards — it has
//! since sent more than one reader to the wrong file.) Adding a route is
//! therefore a two-file change — the caller `record`s its id, ContentRouter
//! grows an arm for it — and nothing needs registering in this file. The
//! failure mode when the router arm is forgotten is a BLANK content pane (the
//! ternary falls through to `""`), recoverable with Back; it is not a crash,
//! which is exactly why it is easy to miss.
//!
//! Ids in use: `home`, `library`, `local`, `localalbum`, `album`, `artist`,
//! `artistreleases`, `settings`, `search`, `playlist`, `discoverbrowse`,
//! `playlistbrowse`, `recentalbums`, `mostplayedalbums`, `label`,
//! `labelreleases`, `mix`, `mixtapes`, `collections`, `mixtapedetail`,
//! `discobuilder`, `blacklist`, `playlistmanager`, `nowplaying`, `scene`,
//! `musician`, `purchases`, `purchase-album`, `queue-view`.
//!
//! `scene` (the "artists from the same place" discovery view) and `musician`
//! both carry a required context that only their opener has, so neither is in
//! the session-restore-safe set below: reopening the app on one would land on
//! a page with nothing to show. Note the musician MODAL is not a route at all —
//! only the `contextual` branch navigates; `weak`/`none` publish a document
//! that a global overlay renders (`musician_qt.rs`).
//!
//! `purchase-album` is in that same context-carrying class (its album id lives
//! in the purchases controller, not in the id), and `purchases` is left out of
//! the restore set for a DIFFERENT reason: it is opt-in and ships hidden
//! (`show_purchases`, default false), so restoring onto it could open the app
//! on a surface whose own entry point is switched off. Neither is in
//! `VIEW_TO_PREF` below, so `startup_view()` can never resolve to either — and
//! neither is offered by the Startup page dropdown, whose own list
//! (`settings_qt::STARTUP_PAGE_VALUES`) would have to grow a matching entry
//! first. The Slint build DOES restore `purchases` (`qbz/src/main.rs:637`);
//! bringing that across is an additive change that needs both halves.
//!
//! `nowplaying` is KIOSK-ONLY (2026-08-02 kiosk-port contract §3): it is the
//! NavRail's fifth tile and the route the kiosk's full-screen player lives on.
//! The desktop shell has no equivalent — its transport is the persistent bar —
//! so `ContentRouter.qml` mounts it only in kiosk mode. It needs no arm in
//! `crate::navigate_to`: the view reads the queue and player bridges, both of
//! which are already live.
