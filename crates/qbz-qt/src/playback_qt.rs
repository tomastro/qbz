//! Minimal playback controller — drives `QbzCore`'s EXISTING public API
//! only (qbz-audio / qbz-player are protected; no audio logic is
//! reimplemented here). Ports the *shape* of `crates/qbz/src/playback.rs`:
//! play_album (fetch -> QueueTrack vec -> set_queue -> play_track_resolved)
//! and the poll loop (PlaybackEvent -> UI state, track-change meta refresh,
//! end-of-track advance).
//!
//! Frontend-owned playback responsibilities implemented here include:
//! - Stop-after-this-song (#35) — the end-of-track arm consumes the marker and
//!   pauses AHEAD of repeat/shuffle, and the gapless pre-queue guard that was
//!   already here now defends a marker the UI can actually place.
//! - Infinite refill (#33) — `try_infinite_refill` chains a smart artist radio
//!   off the ended track when the queue runs out and the ∞ toggle is on.
//! - Gapless prefetch: the engine raises `gapless_ready` ~10s out and this
//!   module now answers it with `play_next` (both the streaming and the
//!   local/DSD arms), so transitions are sample-accurate again.
//! - Blacklist filtering of the QUEUE (#1) + the unavailability drop (contract
//!   2026-08-17 §5.3 D5) — `filter_unplayable_queue` behind
//!   `set_queue_stamped` / `stamped`, the two seams every play/enqueue path
//!   already went through. Both seams DROP; `set_queue_stamped` additionally
//!   returns the surviving anchor, because a caller that computes its own
//!   `first_id` off the pre-filter list plays a track the core does not hold
//!   (F1 — silent, and reachable today through the blacklist alone).
//! - The bounded skip-unavailable walk (#2) — `auto_skip_unavailable`.
//! - Volume persistence (#3) — persisted on drag-end, restored at shell entry.
//! - The stream-failure toast with the Flatpak/Snap ALSA rewrite (#7) —
//!   `stream_error_text`, drained in the poll loop.
//! - The streaming seek lock (#15) — `seekable_max` from `buffer_progress`,
//!   published as `np_seekable_max`.
//! - Shuffle-play reorders the queue instead of latching the global shuffle
//!   MODE (#17) — `xorshift_shuffle` in `play_track_list_in`.
//! - Recently-played / Most-played recording — `recently_qt::record_queue_track`
//!   on the de-duped track edge, EPHEMERAL-EXEMPT: an ephemeral folder plays
//!   and leaves no row behind (owner rule, 2026-07-30). The Slint reference
//!   does NOT have that exemption; do not "restore parity" by removing it.

/// surfaced on the poll loop's track-change edge. 0 = nothing in flight.
///
/// It exists because the cold-start branch in `toggle_play` opened a window the
/// resume branch never had: between dispatch and the first audio frame the
/// engine reports `is_playing == false` AND `has_loaded_audio() == false` — the
/// exact condition that branch tests — so a second Play press would dispatch a
/// SECOND `play_track_resolved` for the same id, racing the first. On this port
/// that window is seconds, not milliseconds (the ACTIVE_TASK notes an
/// unexplained 5459 ms CMAF init).
///
/// THE SHAPE MATTERS, and it is the reference's, not Tauri's. Tauri had a
/// consumed-once `pendingSessionRestore` token that it cleared BEFORE awaiting
/// the load and never re-armed in the catch (`playerStore.ts:522`, `:603-608`),
/// so ONE failed load consumed the restore intent and every later Play press
/// fell through to a bare resume against an empty engine — the Play button was
/// dead for the rest of the session, silently. That is a large part of why this
/// feature "nunca quedaba bien" there.
///
/// This latch cannot do that, because it never gates the ABILITY to start:
///  - Its branch CANCELS the in-flight load (stop + clear) rather than
///    refusing, so a press always does something and always leaves a state the
///    next press can act on.
///  - It is cleared on the track edge AND on every failure path, so a failed
///    cold start re-opens the cold-start branch instead of latching it shut.
///  - Even if it were somehow stranded set, the next press stops and clears it,
///    and the press after that cold-starts normally. It self-heals in both
///    directions; a consumed-once token heals in neither.
///
/// This is also the reference's #661 fix (`crates/qbz/src/playback.rs:4811-4824`):
/// a pause issued during the load window used to fall through to the resume
/// branch and be swallowed — the track started anyway and the sleep inhibitor
/// stayed held with no successful pause to release it.

///    this exact track (once only). That matches the reference, whose audible
///    play calls `take_resume_for` unconditionally.

/// it owns the tier we REQUEST. An offline copy already on disk is served
/// verbatim — `qbz-core` ignores the quality argument on that branch, because
/// downloads are always taken at the top tier. So a capped device still gets
/// the full-rate bytes of a track the user downloaded. Same on the reference;
/// fixing it means transcoding or a second download, neither of which this
/// row is allowed to decide.
///
/// NOT its job: `route_play_to_peer`. Two call-site shapes forbid hoisting it
/// here — `play_queue_track` needs the peer route BEFORE its local-file
/// branch, and the MyQBZ collection play deliberately does not early-return on

    //      "cannot seek - no audio data available". The desktop widget was
    //      being told a position the player was not at and could not reach.

///  - **Hz vs kHz.** `quality_state::detail` normalizes either unit (the
