//! QbzTray — the tray's QML seam (contract rows A-21, A-21b, A-22).
//!
//! Same mechanics as `mini_bridge.rs` / `immersive_bridge.rs`:
//! `OnceLock<CxxQtThread>`, a `ui()` that is a silent no-op before `boot()`,
//! and `impl Default` for construction-seeded values.
//!
//! ## Why this bridge exists at all
//!
//! Rust cannot reach a `QQuickWindow` (contract §2.3), so the tray cannot show,
//! hide, raise or close a window by itself. The hop is:
//!
//! ```text
//! ksni thread -> tray_qt::<verb>() -> tray_bridge::ui(..) -> #[qsignal]
//!             -> Connections in Main.qml -> the window function
//! ```
//!
//! That path is well-trodden, not a first: eleven `#[qsignal]`s across nine
//! bridges already use it, the nearest analogue being
//! `hotkeys_bridge.rs:137-138`'s `focus_search_requested`, consumed at
//! `qml/shell/AppShell.qml:104-107` as
//! `Connections { target: QbzHotkeys; function onFocusSearchRequested() … }`.
//! `#[auto_cxx_name]` is what turns `window_show_requested` into QML's
//! `onWindowShowRequested`.
//!
//! ## Both properties need WRITERS — this is the silent-failure row (A-21b)
//!
//! cxx-qt derives `Default`, so a `bool` `#[qproperty]` nobody writes is
//! `false` FOREVER. `Main.qml`'s close choreography is
//! `QbzTray.trayLive && QbzTray.closeToTray`; with either operand unwritten the
//! expression is permanently false, **every close quits, and the failure looks
//! exactly like "close-to-tray was not implemented"** (§15 trap 31). The three
//! writers, none optional:
//!
//!  - **(a) the seed below**, at construction;
//!  - **(b) `tray_qt::init`'s thread pushes `tray_live`** on BOTH its `Ok` and
//!    its `Err` arm — the two arms the reference sets `TRAY` in
//!    (`crates/qbz/src/tray/mod.rs:151-158`) — and it re-pushes `close_to_tray`
//!    from the per-user store once a session is entered (the seed below runs at
//!    the login screen, where that store is not bound yet);
//!  - **(c) the `"tray-close-to-tray"` Settings write arm** pushes
//!    `close_to_tray` beside its persist, so the toggle changes the very next
//!    close with no restart.
