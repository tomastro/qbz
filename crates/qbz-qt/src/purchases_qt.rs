//! Purchases — the two screens and the download engine.
//!
//! Contract: `qbz-nix-docs/qt-frontend/2026-08-15-purchases-contract/`
//! `00-CONTRACT.md` (behaviour) and `01-BUILD-PLAN.md` §G (the frozen bridge
//! seam). The reference is Tauri's `PurchasesView.svelte` (1,945 lines) +
//! `PurchaseAlbumDetailView.svelte` (1,017 lines) + `purchaseDownloadStore.ts`;
//! the shipping Slint controller (`crates/qbz/src/purchases.rs`) supplied the
//! already-verified line-by-line ports of the pure filter/sort/group functions
//! and the download store's semantics, and NOTHING else — §8 lists four things
//! it invented and one it silently diverged on, and all five are corrected here.
//!
//! # Nobody can smoke-test this
//!
//! Qobuz does not sell purchases in the owner's region, so their account returns
//! an empty list forever. Every populated screen this file feeds will FIRST be
//! seen by a stranger. That is why the pure halves (format re-scoping, the
//! filters, the sort, the path helpers) carry unit tests at the bottom rather
//! than a promise to check them at runtime.
//!
//! # The four corrections to the Slint controller, all §8
//!
//! 1. **`is_controlling_remote()` / skip-if-remote is an INVENTION.** Zero hits
//!    for `skipIfRemote` in any Tauri purchases file; the Slint build silently
//!    no-ops "Download All" while a QConnect peer is active, with no toast.
//!    Not ported.
//! 2. **The album loop registers INSIDE the download.** Slint calls
//!    `download_purchase_track_file_only` and then does a best-effort registry
//!    write that swallows failure, leaving files on disk with no registry row
//!    while reporting success (§8-D1). This calls `download_purchase_track`
//!    with `Some(album_id)`, which registers in the same call and propagates —
//!    a registry failure marks the track `failed`, exactly as BOTH Tauri paths
//!    do.
//! 3. **The album-downloaded rule reads the LOCAL REGISTRY** (`§11-1`, owner
//!    ruling): `apply_download_flags` + `album_downloaded_from_registry`. The
//!    Slint keeps its own copy of the old nested-tracks predicate, which is
//!    unsatisfiable on the Albums tab and pins every card to "not downloaded".
//! 4. **The `metadataLoaded` guard is Tauri's and is owed** — the registry and
//!    the two per-type totals load ONCE per visit, CONCURRENTLY.
//!
//! # The album download is a FRONTEND loop (§4.1)
//!
//! `v2_purchases_download_album` exists in the reference, is registered, is
//! wrapped, and was **never called**. What ran is `purchaseDownloadStore.ts`'s
//! strictly sequential, concurrency-1 loop keyed by album id, honouring a cancel
//! flag checked BEFORE each track. Porting the Rust command instead would lose
//! cancellation and per-track progress. A failed track does NOT abort the album
//! (§4.2b): it is marked `failed`, the loop continues, and only `allComplete`
//! stays false.
//!
//! # The SEND boundary, and why the loop runs on its own thread
//!
//! `download_purchase_track(&client, &db, …)` holds `&LibraryDatabase` across a
//! multi-minute CDN await. `rusqlite::Connection` is `Send` but not `Sync`, so
//! that future is `!Send` and cannot be spawned on the multi-thread runtime. The
//! loop therefore runs on a `spawn_blocking` worker driving a CURRENT-THREAD
//! tokio runtime, which owns its own `LibraryDatabase`. That also gives the
//! required strictly-sequential execution for free.
