//! "Add to playlist" picker — port of `crates/qbz/src/playlist_picker.rs` and
//! the `PlaylistPickerActions` / `DuplicateConfirmActions` handlers in the
//! reference's `main.rs:20070-20615`.
//!
//! One modal, three states in one document: the playlist list (filterable), the
//! inline "Create new playlist" panel, and the duplicate-confirm sub-modal that
//! opens when the chosen target already holds some of the carried tracks.
//!
//! The picker CARRIES a set of tracks and adds them wherever the user points.
//! That is what makes the queue's "save as playlist" work without a save-as
//! endpoint: it seeds the picker with the whole queue and the inline create row
//! turns it into a named playlist — the reference does exactly this
//! (`queue.rs::save_as_playlist`), and every other host (track menus, album /
//! artist / label pages, multi-select bars) is the same call with a different
//! id list.
//!
//! # The list: locals ALWAYS, Qobuz conditionally
//!
//! [`load`] lists the LOCAL playlists (library.db) first and unconditionally,
//! then appends the Qobuz set — unless offline, where the Qobuz half is hidden
//! entirely (decisions D3/D11: a Qobuz playlist cannot be written to offline,
//! so offering it would be a dead target). For a user running QBZ with no Qobuz
//! account, the local half is the WHOLE list.
//!
//! # The four-case matrix (target kind × payload kind)
//!
//! | target | payload | route |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `local:<uuid>` | local refs | `local_playlist_qt::add_local_refs_blocking` |
//! | `local:<uuid>` | Qobuz ids | `local_playlist_qt::add_qobuz_tracks_blocking` |
//! | Qobuz `u64` | local refs | the library.db playlist SIDECAR ([`write_sidecar_refs`]) |
//! | Qobuz `u64` | Qobuz ids | `add_tracks_to_playlist` + the duplicate check |
//!
//! The payload kind rides [`Payload`], a two-variant enum rather than a
//! `Vec<String>` plus an `is_local` flag. With the flag, "refs carried as
//! catalog ids" stays a REPRESENTABLE state, and it is not a state a reviewer
//! can spot by eye: a LocalLibrary row id like `42` parses as a `u64` perfectly
//! happily — it simply means a different track once it reaches Qobuz. With the
//! enum the Qobuz endpoints can only ever be handed a `Payload::Qobuz`, so the
//! confusion is unrepresentable instead of merely avoided. (Same idiom, and the
//! same reason, as `local_playlist_qt::PlaylistRef`.)
//!
//! The duplicate check runs on the Qobuz-target + Qobuz-ids case ONLY — it is
//! the only target whose membership the API can be asked about.
//!
//! # OWED PORT (recorded, not silently dropped)
//!
//! Reco event logging. The reference logs one `PlaylistAdd` per Qobuz id
//! (`reco::log_playlist_add`, with `None` as the playlist id when the target is
//! a local or brand-new playlist) and deliberately does NOT log local refs,
//! whose ids do not resolve against the Qobuz catalog. This port has no reco
//! store at all: `auth_qt.rs`'s header lists `reco` among the per-user stores
//! its session activation does not bind, so there is nothing to log into and
//! even the pre-existing Qobuz→Qobuz add logs nothing. The SOURCE GATE is
//! nevertheless honoured structurally — the local-ref arms below never hold a
//! Qobuz id, so when the store does land there is no path for a non-catalog id
//! to leak into it.
