    // silently (`current_folder_path()` is still None). The late FETCH path
    // does not hit that — it takes seconds — which is exactly why it looked
    // like the cache was the thing that was broken. A row that carries its
    // artwork from the start needs no patching and has no race.
    //
    // `is_file` rather than trust: the artwork cache is evictable.
