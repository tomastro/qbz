//! Per-user library.db access — the local-only playlist flags, ported from
//! `crates/qbz/src/library_db.rs`. Opens
//! `<data_dir>/qbz/users/<uid>/library.db` on demand via the `qbz-library`
//! backend crate (ADR-006 — no glue copied).
//!
//! Why a LOCAL db and not the Qobuz API: the playlist heart is a qbz-only
//! flag. `/favorite/create` and `/favorite/delete` accept exactly five id
//! params — `album_ids`, `artist_ids`, `track_ids`, `label_ids`, `award_ids`
//! (inferred OpenAPI v10.0.0.0-beta, §Favorites) — there is no
//! `playlist_ids`, which is why the reference routes `("playlist",
//! "favorite")` to `db.set_playlist_favorite` instead (main.rs:13652, its
//! comment: "Qobuz /favorite/create rejects playlist_ids").
//!
//! `LibraryDatabase` holds a non-Send `rusqlite::Connection`, so every call
//! opens it fresh; async callers must wrap these in `spawn_blocking`.

/// `last_user_id` was absent, which is the state of a machine that has never
/// completed a Qobuz login: for that user `db_path()` was permanently `None`,
/// so `with_db` answered `None` to every call and the ENTIRE local-playlist
/// feature (plus folders, local favourites and the mixtape tables) simply did
/// not exist — for exactly the population local playlists are FOR. It survived
/// review because every developer machine has logged in at least once.
///
/// `users/0/` is the designed home for that data, not an invention:
/// `AppRuntime::activate_offline` resolves its own user with the SAME

/// renames `users/0/` onto the account on first login precisely so work done
/// logged-off follows the user in. The reference has no such hole because it
/// binds a session-scoped id instead (`library_db::set_user(user_id)` from
/// `init_shell_for_user`, which qbz/src/main.rs:172 documents as shared by the
/// ONLINE AND OFFLINE entries) — this is the port's substitution of
/// `load_last_user_id()` for that id, made to agree with it in the one case
/// where they diverged.
