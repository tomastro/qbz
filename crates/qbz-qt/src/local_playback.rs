//! Local Library playback: `LocalTrack` -> `QueueTrack` -> `core().set_queue`
//! -> the player's audible seam.
//!
//! Split out of `local_library_qt.rs` (phase-24 modularization). A queue built
//! here can mix LOCAL files, EPHEMERAL rows, OFFLINE (Qobuz download) copies
//! and PLEX rows.
//!
//! THE AUDIBLE STEP IS NO LONGER HERE (design 02 §9 stage 3). This file used
//! to own `play_local_file`, `play_plex_track` and a `plex_rating_key` ladder,
//! and `local_album_actions` + `local_ephemeral` each carried their own copy of
//! the same routine. All three are gone: `qbz_source::SourceRegistry::playback`
//! claims the row and answers with a `PlaybackTicket`, and `audible_qt`
//! performs it. What is left here is queue BUILDING — mapping rows, ordering
//! them, stamping context — plus `play_audible`, which is now one call.
//!
//! The PROTECTED audio path is entered in `audible_qt`, never modified: the
//! bytes go to the same `play_data` seam the Slint frontend uses, so sample
//! rate / bit depth stay whatever the decoder found.

/// WHY THIS EXISTS. `playback_qt::queue_track_for` has exactly two arms — the
/// Qobuz favourites feed, then `get_track` against the catalog — so any id that
/// misses the feed goes to the Qobuz API. For a local or Plex id that is a
/// guaranteed 404 (reported by the owner from Discover's Recently-Played rail:
/// `get_track(1099511673001)` on a `PLEX_TRACK_ID_FLOOR`-namespaced id). The
/// cortinilla has routed by source since it was written and says why in its own
/// comment: handing a local id to the catalog "would 404 or, worse, open
/// someone else's album that happens to share the number". This is that seam
/// for the rails that reach playback through the generic by-id entry.
///
/// ROUTING IS BY THE ROW'S `source`, NEVER BY ID ARITHMETIC. `id >=
/// PLEX_TRACK_ID_FLOOR` is only unambiguous for Plex; plain local ids are small
/// `library.db` rowids that CAN collide with real Qobuz track ids, so a
/// speculative `get_track()` on the local DB could play the wrong file. It is
/// also what keeps Jellyfin/Navidrome a match arm here instead of another sweep
/// through the tree.
///
/// An unresolvable row plays NOTHING and says so. Falling back to the Qobuz
/// path would reproduce the 404 this exists to remove, and falling back to
/// "some other track" is the failure the cortinilla explicitly refuses.
