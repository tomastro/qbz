///    the NEXT republish, whatever causes it) and rebuilds the Pinned rail
///    on its own `pinnedJson` property. The three tab documents are left
///    alone.
///  - `recommendations_qt::apply_pin_change` — same shape for that tab's
///    separate cache; badge-only (it has no pinned rail).

///    cached page is re-published routinely (the artwork pass after `submit`,
///    plus `tab_changed` / `load_more` / `filter_changed`), and each of those
///    swaps the model out from under the card: without the patch the stale
///    `isPinned` in the cache silently reverted the user's flip a second after
///    the click, whenever a cover happened to land.
///  - `library_qt::apply_pin_change` — patches the cached merged feed. Only
///    re-serialized by a full `reload_library` today, so it is the cheap
///    insurance rather than a live bug.
///
/// EVERY consumer here is a cache patch or an in-place badge signal. The rule

/// under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=vnc` the same day: in Qt 6, `Qt.quit()` delivers
/// `QEvent::Quit`, and `QGuiApplication::event` first tries to CLOSE every
/// top-level window — any window refusing its close event silently CANCELS
/// the whole quit (qtbase `QGuiApplicationPrivate::tryCloseAllWindows`). Two
/// windows here refuse: Main.qml's close-to-tray arm (whenever
/// `trayLive && closeToTray`) and MiniWindow.qml's `onClosing`
/// (unconditionally — its close means "exit the mini", never "quit the app").
/// The log signature of the bug: `[tray] quit requested` and the QML
/// handler's `Qt.quit()` both fire, and `event loop exited` never appears.
///
/// The FIX is that every quit path now calls `Qt.exit(0)`, which exits the
/// event loops directly with no window veto. THIS watchdog is the backstop
/// behind it: armed at the moment quit is REQUESTED (and again, idempotently,
/// when the loop exits), it hard-terminates the process if any later stage —
/// signal delivery, QML, the loop itself, the cast shutdown, a Qt/QML/Wayland
/// destructor, an atexit handler — wedges.
///
/// `libc::_exit` on purpose: `std::process::exit` runs libc `exit()`, whose
/// atexit chain is where Qt's `Q_GLOBAL_STATIC` destructors live — a hang
/// there is one of the wedges being guarded against — and `abort()` would
/// SIGABRT/core-dump a healthy shutdown.
///
/// SAFE BY DESIGN, not by luck: everything the app owes the user is already
/// on disk before any quit path arms this — the geometry flushes in the QML
/// quit handlers BEFORE `Qt.exit(0)`, prefs/settings persist on change, and
/// the stores write at mutation time. Skipping C++ teardown loses nothing the

    //      with its FontLoaders already in the font database.

    //      not follow ApplicationWindow.font (Controls only), and it ignores
    //      a later QGuiApplication::setFont. Both measured against this Qt
    //      build; the evidence is written up in qml/FontPreload.qml.

    //      born with the chosen face.

    // Swap any two of those steps and the setting silently does nothing,
    // which is exactly how it shipped the first time.
