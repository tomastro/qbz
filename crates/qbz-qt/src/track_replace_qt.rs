//! "Find available version" — replace a track Qobuz PULLED from the catalogue
//! with a live one, in a playlist the user owns (contract §6).
//!
//! The reference (Tauri's `TrackReplacementModal.svelte`) had this feature and
//! shipped it with four defects; Slint never had it at all. All four are fixed
//! here rather than ported:
//!
//!  1. **It was unranked.** Tauri showed Qobuz's raw relevance order and let the
//!     human sort it out. The weighted matcher that already lives in
//!     `qbz-playlist-import` — ISRC short-circuit, title 0.6 / artist 0.3 /
//!     album 0.1, duration bonus, stop-word normalisation, quality tie-break —
//!     does the ranking here, through its `rank_candidates` entry point.
//!  2. **It never tried the ISRC.** Licensing churn most often re-publishes the
//!     SAME recording under a new track id with the SAME ISRC, and the dead row
//!     keeps its `isrc` (confirmed in the 2026-08-17 capture of album
//!     `0886443985094`). That case needs no human judgement at all, so
//!     `find_by_isrc` runs FIRST and its hit is pinned to the top of the list.
//!  3. **It removed before it added**, so a failed add lost the track outright.
//!     The order here is add -> reposition -> remove: if the add fails nothing
//!     was destroyed and the user simply still has a dead row.
//!  4. **It did not preserve position** — the replacement landed at the end and
//!     the computed index was used only in a `console.log`. Owner ruling §C.1:
//!     preserve it, through `/playlist/updateTracksPosition`.
//!
//! # The two guards, and why each exists
//!
//! **Same-id (§A F10).** If the ISRC lookup answers with the DEAD track itself
//! — which it can, because a pulled track keeps its metadata and Qobuz's search
//! still indexes it — then "replace" would be `add` (a `no_duplicate` no-op)
//! followed by `remove`, and the user would lose the row outright while being
//! told it was repaired. Any candidate whose id equals the dead track's is
//! dropped before it can ever be selected, and [`apply`] re-checks it.
//!
//! **Failed remove (§A F10, second half).** Add-then-remove trades "lose the
//! track" for "transient duplicate", and the duplicate is transient only if the
//! remove succeeds. When it does not, the playlist permanently holds BOTH rows.
//! This is not rolled back: a rollback is a second write that can fail the same
//! way, and it would delete the only good copy. Instead the playlist is
//! refreshed so the user SEES both rows, and the toast says plainly that the
//! old one is still there and has to go by hand — never that a reload will fix
//! it, because nothing will.
//!
//! # Position is a nicety, never a reason to abort
//!
//! The reposition step needs the membership id the server minted for the row we
//! just appended, which only a re-fetch can tell us, and `insert_before`'s exact
//! encoding is the one part of the new verb no capture in the repo pins down. So
//! every failure in that step is a `log::warn!` and a different success toast —
//! the repair still stands, at the end of the playlist, exactly where the
//! reference always put it.
