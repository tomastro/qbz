//! THE audible step — design 02 §9 stage 3.
//!
//! One exhaustive `match` over [`PlaybackTicket`], and it is the ONLY place
//! this port enters the PROTECTED audio path for a row a source owns. Before
//! this module there were three near-copies of it, and they had already
//! drifted apart:
//!
//! | copy | Plex arm | CUE fast path | offline row id |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `local_playback::play_audible` | `plex_rating_key` ladder | by track **id** | queue id (the Qobuz id — wrong row) |
//! | `local_album_actions::play_audible` | same ladder, copy-pasted | none | same |
//! | `local_ephemeral::play_file` | n/a | by file **path** | n/a |
//!
//! Three copies, three behaviours, and every one of them a `match` on
//! `track.source` — the shape design 02 §0 catalogues as the defect the seam
//! exists to remove. `qbz_source::SourceRegistry::playback` claims the row
//! ONCE and answers with a ticket; this file performs it.
//!
//! **What stays here and cannot move into `qbz-source`:** every call below
//! that touches `runtime.core().player()`. That crate deliberately does not
//! link `qbz-player` / `qbz-audio` (design 02 §8), so it can describe what to
//! play and never how the samples are handled. Nothing in this file touches
//! sample rate, resampling or device selection — the bytes go to the same
//! `play_data` / `play_dsd_file` seams the Slint frontend uses, so bit depth
//! and rate stay whatever the decoder found.
//!
//! ## The CUE fast path is now exact
//!
//! Every virtual track of a CUE album shares ONE audio file, so moving between
//! them should seek, not re-read a 300 MB container. The two old copies tested
//! for that differently and BOTH were incomplete:
//!
//! - `local_playback` compared the loaded **track id** to the one being
//!   played. Each virtual track is its own `local_tracks` row with its own id,
//!   so that test only passed when re-playing the *same* virtual track — i.e.
//!   never for the case the fast path exists to serve.
//! - `local_ephemeral` compared **file paths**, which is the right question,
//!   but it could only answer it for rows in the session store.
//!
//! [`LAST_LOADED`] records what the last successful `play_data` actually read.
//! The test becomes "does the player still hold audio, is it still the load I
//! made, and was that load this same file?" — correct for library CUE albums
//! and ephemeral ones alike, with no source lookup on the hot path.

/// this app already has, and it works.
///
/// Three things differ, and each is a decision rather than a detail:
///
/// 1. **A 16-bit header.** `qbz_dsd::wav_header` is hardcoded to 24-bit, the
///    depth its converter emits. Reusing it would either lie in the header or
///    promote 16-bit samples to 24 — and while that shift is arithmetically
///    lossless, it makes the DAC open at 24 bits for a 16-bit source. That is
///    the silent conversion a bit-perfect path must not contain.
///
/// 2. **The feeder stops when the track changes.** The DSD thread used to
///    rely on `push_chunk` returning `Err`, which it cannot do; this one polls
///    `current_track_id()`, the same signal `play_file` above reads, and stops
///    the moment the player is on something else. Without it, skipping a track
///    would leave the drive spinning and a 160 MB buffer growing for nothing.
///
/// 3. **A read error ends the track.** No zero-fill, no skip-ahead. A hole
///    that sounds like silence is indistinguishable from music that was meant
///    to be quiet, and on a bit-perfect path that is worse than stopping.
