//! QbzPlaylistEdit — the SHARED playlist editor's QML singleton (contract
//! §3.3, block 3). Port of `primitives/EditPlaylistModal.slint` plus the
//! `EditPlaylistActions` handlers in the reference's `main.rs`.
//!
//! The third of the three singletons the Playlist Manager surface owns (D2):
//! `QbzPlaylistManager` holds the manager document and the organisation
//! writes, `QbzFolderEdit` owns the two folder panels, and this one owns the
//! ONE rename / description / offline-only / delete modal — for BOTH kinds of
//! playlist (`local:<uuid>` and a Qobuz `u64`) and from every surface that
//! offers "Edit playlist":
//!
//!   * the manager's grid card, list row and tree row (block 4),
//!   * the sidebar's row context menu (block 5),
//!   * the playlist DETAIL header's pencil (block 7) — which is why
//!     `qml/views/PlaylistView.qml`'s inline rename+delete popup is deleted:
//!     it could express neither a description nor the offline-only flag, and
//!     a second editor is exactly the fork the port rule forbids.
//!
//! It is a SEPARATE singleton from `QbzPlaylist` for the same reason
//! `QbzPlaylistPicker` is: its callers live outside the detail view, and in
//! most of those sessions no playlist detail is open at all — so nothing here
//! may read the open document, and a detail republish can never perturb an
//! open editor.
//!
//! # ONE document, and the id is NOT in QML's hands
//!
//! `editJson` (§4.6) carries the seeds plus `descLoaded`, `isLocal` and
//! `busy`. The id being edited lives in RUST state and is never echoed back
//! from QML: a republish can then never make the modal save under the wrong
//! id, which is the same rule `folder_edit_qt` holds the folder id under.
//!
//! # `descLoaded` is load-bearing, not cosmetic (§5.2)
//!
//! `false` means the real description could not be resolved. The modal then
//! does NOT render the description field at all and `save` passes `None`,
//! which `update_playlist` reads as "leave it alone". A field the user never
//! saw can never overwrite stored data. The reference seeds `""` and always
//! sends `Some(trimmed)`, so renaming a Qobuz playlist from its manager
//! DELETES its description; the local branch writes SQL NULL. Neither is
//! ported.
//!
//! # `busy` HOLDS THE MODAL OPEN (D22)
//!
//! Save and delete disarm the buttons and keep the panel up; it closes on
//! success only, and a failure stays open and toasts. `close()` is refused
//! while busy. Same shape as the folder panels.
//!
//! **No `#[qsignal]`** — outcomes are republishes and toasts
//! (`playlist_picker_bridge.rs:13`).
//!
//! `delete` is a C++ keyword, so the member is `delete_playlist` /
//! `deletePlaylist` (§3.3). The module is `qbz_playlist_edit_bridge` — a
//! bridge module is never named after a workspace crate (E0659).
