//! Artist detail data layer — Slint-free port of `crates/qbz/src/artist.rs`
//! (`load_artist`/`map_artist`, `load_release_page`, the release-section
//! bucketing in the official order). Publishes ONE JSON document.
//!
//! The page publishes PROGRESSIVELY: `load_artist_view` returns the Qobuz
//! document immediately (main.rs sets it on the bridge), then a background
//! task re-publishes the SAME document enriched with the Magazine stories and
//! the MusicBrainz network-sidebar sections as each one resolves. The stashed
//! copy is generation-guarded so a late reply for a previous artist is
//! dropped instead of overwriting the current page.
//!
//! MusicBrainz is OPT-IN-RESPECTING: `network.mbAvailable` is seeded from
//! `core.musicbrainz_is_enabled()` BEFORE anything is fetched — when the user
//! has MB off, no resolve/metadata/relationship/discovery request is made at
//! all and the Origin / Relationships / You-may-also-like sections are simply
//! absent from the sidebar (never an error, never an empty frame).
//!
//! Known delta: the "In library" tab has album/track content but not the
//! reference's playlist sub-list.
//! - `is_following` seeds from `library_qt::is_favorite` — the favourite-id
//!   cache first (the reference's `fav_cache`, now ported as `fav_cache_qt`),
//!   the phase-5 library feed second. It used to read the feed ALONE, which is
//!   empty until the Library view is opened: the heart drew un-followed on
//!   artists the user follows, and the toggle then re-ADDED the follow.
//! - Discovery runs with EMPTY `dismissed_per_tag` / `known_artists`
//!   callbacks: the Slint app feeds those from `discovery_dismiss` +
//!   `play_history` + `reco`; this path still uses empty callbacks. That is the
//!   same default a first-run Slint profile lands on (no exclusion applied),
//!   not a fabricated one.
//! - The blacklist banner, Artist Scene/location navigation, collection
//!   builder and jump-scroll tracking are live in `ArtistView.qml`.
