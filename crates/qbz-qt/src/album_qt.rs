//! Album detail data layer — Slint-free port of `crates/qbz/src/album.rs`
//! (map_album: credits/meta/description/tracks) plus the three bottom
//! carousels ("From the same artist" via get_releases_grid, "Listening
//! suggestions" via get_album_suggest, "Similar albums" via Last.fm).
//! Publishes ONE JSON document.
//!
//! The page publishes PROGRESSIVELY, exactly like `navigate_album` in the
//! Slint app (`crates/qbz/src/main.rs`): `load_album_view` returns the PRIMARY
//! document — header + tracks — as soon as `/album/get` lands, and a detached
//! task then re-publishes the SAME document with each carousel folded in as it
//! resolves. Before this the whole page waited on the Last.fm row (an external
//! service plus MusicBrainz) before a single track was rendered.
//!
//! Every deferred row carries its OWN loading flag, seeded before the first
//! serialization so the view can mount a placeholder with the first frame:
//! `moreLoading`, `suggestionsLoading`, `similarLoading`. A row that CANNOT
//! resolve (no artist id, Last.fm not connected) is seeded `false` — its
//! placeholder never appears and the section stays absent, which is also what
//! an empty result produces. Late replies are generation-guarded, so a slow
//! Last.fm answer for album A can never paint onto album B.
//!
//! Known parity delta: artist/album blacklist filtering is not yet applied to
//! the three recommendation carousels. Multi-select, offline actions, the
//! header atmosphere and the Last.fm similar-albums row are all live.
