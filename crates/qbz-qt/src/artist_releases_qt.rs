//! Dedicated artist discography page — the Qt half of
//! `crates/qbz/src/artist_releases.rs` (99 lines, the whole file) plus the four
//! `main.rs` handlers that drive it:
//!
//!  - `main.rs:15055-15087` `.on_open_releases`     -> `open`
//!  - `main.rs:3570-3607`   `navigate_artist_releases` (the fetch half)
//!  - `main.rs:15098-15135` `.on_load_more`         -> `load_more`
//!  - `main.rs:15143-15148` `.on_set_sort`          -> `set_sort`
//!  - `main.rs:15158-15176` `.on_retry`             -> `retry`
//!
//! The page is the full, paginated grid for ONE release bucket of ONE artist,
//! reached from the artist page's "See discography" link
//! (`artist/ReleaseGrid.slint:54-69`) and from the album page's "From the same
//! artist" View-all (`album/AlbumPageView.slint:1123-1136`, which pins the
//! bucket to `"album"`). Two doors, one page — hence `open` takes the artist
//! NAME as a parameter instead of reading it off the artist document: the album
//! page supplies its own (`main.rs:11844-11848`).
//!
//! # Why this file does NOT call `artist_qt::load_release_page`
//!
//! That function exists for the artist page's per-section "Load more" and it
//! ends in `merge_release_page`, which folds every fetched page into the
//! STASHED ARTIST DOCUMENT (`artist_qt::ARTIST_DOC`). Paging this page ten deep
//! would silently grow the artist page's own "Albums" grid to 200 cards behind
//! the user's back. The reference keeps `ArtistState.release-sections` and
//! `ArtistReleasesState.albums` strictly disjoint (two states, one endpoint),
//! so this file issues the identical core call itself:
//!
//! ```text
//! get_releases_grid(id, release_type, RELEASE_PAGE_SIZE, offset, Some("release_date"))
//! ```
//!
//! Same 20-row page size, same server sort — there is no separate discography
//! endpoint, and `Some("release_date")` is what makes the picker's "Default"
//! option mean something (see `sort_cards`).
//!
//! # Why the rows are `home_qt::HomeCard`, not `album_qt::AlbumCardData`
//!
//! The view mounts the shared `views/AlbumCollection.qml`, whose delegates read
//! `modelData.artPath` (`AlbumCollection.qml:391`) — a Rust-resolved cache path.
//! `AlbumCardData` carries `artUrl` and NO `artPath`, which is why the artist
//! page resolves its covers in QML through `QbzShell.sidebarArtworkWindow` ->
//! `QbzLibrary.libraryArtworkReady` -> its own `coverMap`. Publishing
//! `AlbumCardData` into `AlbumCollection` compiles, mounts, and draws every
//! cover BLANK. So the fetch runs the `label_qt::fetch_releases` two-pass
//! (`label_qt.rs:800-847`): `home_qt::attach_card_art` for what is already on
//! disk, publish, `artwork_qt::download_missing`, re-attach, publish again.
//!
//! # The subtitle slot carries the YEAR
//!
//! `qbz/src/artist.rs:670-698` `card_to_item`: "the card subtitle slot should
//! show the release year — the artist is redundant since we're already on their
//! page". It routes `year` through the card's `artist` field and blanks
//! `artist_id` so the line is inert, while `plain_year` keeps the real value
//! for the sort. `HomeCard` has no `plain_year`, so here `artist` AND `year`
//! both carry the year and `sort_cards` reads `year` — never `artist`, which
//! only happens to work while every release has one.
