//! Artwork pipeline — SOURCE-AWARE resolution for every QBZ art source.
//!
//! Every surface (Home rails, search, playlists, the queue panel, the
//! now-playing bar, the ambient triad) hands this module an `art_url` and
//! gets back a `file://` path QML can decode. Those urls are NOT all HTTP,
//! and treating them as if they were is what left local and Plex covers
//! blank. The taxonomy is the same one the Slint frontend routes on
//! (`crates/qbz/src/queue.rs` `load_artwork`, `artwork.rs`
//! `fetch_and_decode_ref`):
//!
//! | shape                          | class              | resolution              |
//! |--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
//! | `http://` / `https://`         | [`ArtUrl::Http`]   | disk cache, else download|
//! | `file:///…`                    | [`ArtUrl::LocalFile`] | strip + stat, NO fetch |
//! | `/abs/path/cover.jpg`          | [`ArtUrl::LocalFile`] | stat, NO fetch        |
//! | `/library/…` `/photo/…`        | [`ArtUrl::Plex`]   | tokenize, then as HTTP  |
//! | Plex path, no server/token     | [`ArtUrl::PlexUnconfigured`] | unresolvable  |
//!
//! A `file://` url can never be handed to reqwest ("builder error for url"),
//! and a bare `/library/...` path has no scheme at all — both are resolved
//! WITHOUT the network here, and [`download_missing`] drops them instead of
//! trying to GET them.
//!
//! Plex credentials come from `local_plex` (the same store the Local Library
//! grid reads) and the thumb url is built by `local_plex::thumb_url`, so a
//! cover fetched for the Albums grid and the same cover in the queue share
//! ONE cache entry ([`PLEX_THUMB_PX`] is the single transcode size).
//!
//! ## Repeat visits resolve from RAM
//!
//! `ImageCacheService::get` is not a read: it stats the file AND runs an
//! `UPDATE … SET last_accessed` on the shared SQLite connection, behind the
//! process-wide cache mutex that the 16 concurrent downloaders also hold to
//! `store`. The window dispatches call it once per visible card, on the Qt
//! GUI thread, on EVERY window pass — so a second visit to a view queued
//! dozens of write transactions behind the downloaders instead of resolving
//! the already-on-disk covers straight away (the "grey squares that fill in
//! unevenly" report). [`RESOLVED`] memoizes url -> cached file path so a
//! repeat lookup is a read-lock + one stat, with no SQLite and no contention
//! with the download pool. Entries are dropped when the file is gone (another
//! process may evict the shared cache), so the memo can never serve a dead
//! path.
//!
//! POC-NOTE: on download completion the WHOLE section list is republished
//! (a `homeSectionsJson` swap) — per-row QAbstractListModel updates are
//! the documented follow-up. No RGBA decode in Rust: QML `Image` decodes
//! `file://` asynchronously and natively.
//!
//! ## Cache eviction — scaled derivatives only
//!
//! [`housekeeping`] bounds `~/.cache/qbz/images/scaled` (this module's OWN
//! derivative directory) at [`MAX_SCALED_BYTES`], LRU by mtime, and does the
//! one-time `.jpg` orphan sweep the `.png` key change left behind. The PARENT
//! `~/.cache/qbz/images` is the SHARED cache and keeps its own policy
//! (`qbz_cache::ImageCacheService`, SQLite `last_accessed` + the Slint app's
//! 200 MB `evict`) — do NOT add a second one for it from here.

///    square covers forced into a 32x28 box — and squashed every LOGO into
///    the square `fit: "contain"` box of `LabelCard`. The caller asks for the

///    for `contain` and for a square cell, and merely soft (never distorted)
///    in the one remaining case, a non-square crop cell.
///  * **Alpha survives.** The old body went through `to_rgb8()`, so a label
///    logo shipped as a transparent PNG came back matted onto black. PNG out,
///    same colour type in as out.
///  * **The re-encode is LOSSLESS.** The old body wrote JPEG at the crate
///    default (quality 75 — verified against the quantisation tables of the
///    files already in `~/.cache/qbz/images/scaled`), which costs more than
///    the resample it was meant to fix: measured against a Lanczos reference
