//! Queue panel controller — Slint-free port of the `QueueState` assembly
//! side of `crates/qbz/src/queue.rs`: NOW PLAYING card, UP NEXT with the
//! #442 "Next in queue" / "Next up" section markers (from the core's
//! `manual_next_count`), 40-row pagination, live search filter, and the
//! History tab. Mutations go straight to the core queue API; every one
//! ends with a republish.
//!
//! OWED PORTS (what the reference has and this file still does not):
//! - QConnect remote reorder — `reorder_upcoming_if_remote` is offered the
//!   move FIRST in the reference (the cloud is authoritative for queue order
//!   while connected). There is no QConnect service in this port yet, so the
//!   local core path is the only one; when the service lands, `move_track`
//!   grows that arm BEFORE `core().move_track`.
//!
//! The immersive coverflow's flat model (the old second owed port) is now
//! fed by `publish_coverflow` below (immersive-port contract §4.4).
//!
//! Row favorite seeds from the phase-5 library feed (Slint uses fav_cache —
//! same truth).
