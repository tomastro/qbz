//! System tray — the platform-agnostic façade.
//!
//! Port of `crates/qbz/src/tray/mod.rs` (391 L) per the 2026-08-03
//! miniplayer/tray contract (rows A-19, A-23, A-24; §5.1, §5.6, §5.8).
//! The ksni half lives in `tray_linux.rs` (A-20); the QObject QML talks to is
//! `tray_bridge.rs` (A-21).
//!
//! Linux uses ksni (`tray_linux.rs`), macOS uses NSStatusItem
//! (`tray_macos.rs`), and Windows uses Shell_NotifyIcon (`tray_windows.rs`).
//!
//! RETIRED 2026-08-05 — the note that used to sit here said macOS "would be a
//! NEW implementation, not a port", because the reference only hand-rolls its
//! menu-bar item to dodge the `muda` that Slint's winit backend bundles, and
//! Qt has no such conflict. The premise was right and the conclusion was
//! backwards: `tray/macos.rs` avoids muda entirely, depends on nothing winit
//! provides, and ported here almost verbatim (it got SHORTER — its
//! `CTX`/`slint::Weak` plumbing has no counterpart on this side). The cost of
//! believing it: the owner's macOS smoke found the tray icon missing and
//! close-to-tray quitting the app, which is the one absence wearing two
//! faces.
//!
//! ## Three things about this module are not style choices
//!
//! 1. **Nothing here touches a window.** Rust cannot reach a `QQuickWindow`
//!    (§2.3), so every window verb emits a `#[qsignal]` on `QbzTray` and QML's
//!    `Connections` in `Main.qml` answers it — the same hop
//!    `hotkeys_bridge.rs:137-138` → `qml/shell/AppShell.qml:104-107` already
//!    uses for `focus_search_requested`.
//! 2. **Nothing here calls `ksni`.** `ksni`'s blocking API wraps every call in
//!    `Runtime::block_on`, which panics inside a tokio runtime **and the panic
//!    is swallowed, so updates appear to succeed and never apply**
//!    (`ksni-0.3.4/src/blocking.rs:206-208`; the reference states it twice,
//!    `tray/mod.rs:141-150` and `tray/linux.rs:320-327`). `init` runs the ksni
//!    setup on a dedicated `qbz-tray-init` thread and every mutation crosses an
//!    `mpsc` into a second `qbz-tray-updater` thread. §15 traps 24-25.
//! 3. **The tray does zero work per tick** (§7-M12). Every update below is
//!    edge-triggered by its publisher; there is no tray poll and no tray timer.
//!
//! On non-Linux targets the whole surface is inert, so the per-item
//! `allow(dead_code)` noise is collapsed into one module attribute rather than
//! sprinkled over a dozen items.
#![cfg_attr(not(target_os = "linux"), allow(dead_code))]
