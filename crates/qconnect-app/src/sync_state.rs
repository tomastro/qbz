//! Cross-frontend QConnect remote-sync accumulator.
//!
//! Caches the cloud's renderer/queue snapshots, the most recent
//! materialization, the session topology, the per-renderer cached state, the
//! load-attempt dedup window, and the renderer-liveness watchdog epoch.
//!
//! This is held behind a SINGLE Mutex shared by the session/liveness path and
//! the renderer-materialize path. That single-lock sharing is load-bearing:
//! `capture_session_state_takeover_input` reads session topology together with
//! per-renderer state, and the materialize path reads `last_renderer_*` together
//! with `last_applied_queue_state`, all atomically. Splitting these across two
//! locks would tear the takeover decision. So it stays ONE struct under ONE
//! lock. Relocated here (slice 2+4) so all adapters share it; the owning `Mutex`
//! is held by the adapter / `QconnectApp`.
//!
//! Mutated by the event sink (on inbound events), the renderer engine (on
//! materialize/apply), track loading (on load attempt), and the service loop
//! (on outbound report completions).
