//! Shared HTTP client for all providers.
//!
//! The Tauri original built a new connection pool per request (`reqwest::get`
//! in four call sites, `Client::new()` per Tidal fetch, plus a builder client
//! per token fetch) — each one its own fd pool, which exhausted file
//! descriptors (EMFILE) on large imports. One `OnceLock` client fixes that;
//! async flavor of the existing blocking precedent in
//! `qbz-media-controls/src/notify.rs`.
//!
//! UA policy (behavior-faithful): NO default User-Agent on the client —
//! the scrapers go out exactly as before; only the Tidal proxy token request
//! sets [`USER_AGENT`] per-request, as the original did.

/// User-Agent sent to the QBZ credential proxy (Tidal token fetch only).
