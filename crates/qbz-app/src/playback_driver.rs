// crates/qbz-app/src/playback_driver.rs — the headless playback orchestrator.
//
// This re-hosts, as a PURE decision function plus a thin IO shell, the playback
// bookkeeping that today only exists inside the desktop's 450 ms poll loop
// (`crates/qbz/src/playback.rs::start_poll_loop`): end-of-track detection,
// auto-advance, gapless pre-queue, stop-after, seamless-transition cursor sync
// and the periodic session-position save. Every branch below cites the exact
// desktop line it mirrors — the desktop is the reference for tie-breaks, the
// unit tests pin the observable contract (01-architecture.md §3.2).
//
// Split of concerns:
//   * `plan_tick`      — side-effect-free: (state, event, queue, error) → actions
//   * `advance_state`  — the pure state-update rule the shell applies each tick
//   * `next_playable`  — bounded unstreamable skip-walk (mirrors
//                        `playback.rs::advance_to_playable`, capped at
//                        `MAX_OFFLINE_SKIPS`)
//   * `run_driver`     — the 450 ms IO shell that reads the player, calls
//                        `plan_tick`, and executes the resulting actions
//   * `advance_and_play` — the full advance ritual (skip-walk → play → prefetch
//                        → persist), reused verbatim by the CLI next/prev routes
