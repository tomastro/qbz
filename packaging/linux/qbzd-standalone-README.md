# qbzd — QBZ headless Qobuz playback daemon (standalone download)

This tarball is the independent daemon download (no dependency on the desktop
`qbz` app, no deb/rpm needed). Install it on the box wired to your DAC — a
Raspberry Pi, an LXC, a living-room NUC — run `qbzd setup` once, and it
appears in the official Qobuz app as a Qobuz Connect device.

## Contents

- `qbzd` — the daemon binary (also its own CLI client and setup TUI)
- `qbzd.service` — a systemd user unit (shipped, not enabled); the binary can
  also generate systemd system units, OpenRC scripts, and runit services
- `completions/` — bash/zsh/fish shell completions

## Install

Recommended — matches the shipped unit's `ExecStart=/usr/bin/qbzd run`:

```bash
sudo install -Dm755 qbzd /usr/bin/qbzd
sudo install -Dm644 qbzd.service /usr/lib/systemd/user/qbzd.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Prefer a user-local install instead? Copy `qbzd` anywhere on your `$PATH`
(e.g. `~/.local/bin/qbzd`), then edit `qbzd.service`'s `ExecStart=` line to
point at that path before copying it to `~/.config/systemd/user/qbzd.service`
and running `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.

Shell completions (optional):

```bash
sudo cp completions/qbzd.bash /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/qbzd
# zsh: copy completions/qbzd.zsh into a directory on your $fpath
# fish: copy completions/qbzd.fish into ~/.config/fish/completions/
```

## Required: enable linger

Without linger, the user unit stops the moment you log out of SSH and the
device vanishes from the Qobuz app:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

`qbzd status` warns when linger is off.

## First run

```bash
qbzd setup
```

`qbzd setup` is the six-screen configurator: log in to Qobuz, pick the audio
device, name the Connect device. It edits the same stores `qbzd run` reads,
so one pass is enough (revisit any time to change a setting).

Then enable and start the daemon:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now qbzd
systemctl --user status qbzd
```

## OpenRC and runit

Do not reuse the systemd unit on a non-systemd host. `qbzd` generates a
service definition for the init system that is actually running and fills in
the target user's `HOME`, group, UID-derived runtime directory, and binary
path. Run it as the playback user so auto-detection and defaults describe the
right account:

```bash
qbzd service --user "$USER" --bin /usr/bin/qbzd
```

The generated definition is written to stdout and the exact install/enable
commands are written to stderr. You can also select the init explicitly:

```bash
# OpenRC
qbzd service openrc --user "$USER" --bin /usr/bin/qbzd \
  | sudo tee /etc/init.d/qbzd >/dev/null
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/qbzd
sudo rc-update add qbzd default

# runit (adjust the enabled-service symlink for the distribution)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/sv/qbzd
qbzd service runit --user "$USER" --bin /usr/bin/qbzd \
  | sudo tee /etc/sv/qbzd/run >/dev/null
sudo chmod +x /etc/sv/qbzd/run
```

The OpenRC/runit service is system-scoped but drops privileges to the selected
user. Keep that user in the `audio` group for ALSA Direct and ensure its
`/run/user/<uid>` exists when using PipeWire or PulseAudio.

## System service (appliances and HiFiBerryOS)

`qbzd` can also emit a **system-scoped** unit. This is the form an appliance
manager can control with ordinary `systemctl` even when no user is logged in:

```bash
qbzd service systemd --system --user "$USER" --bin /usr/bin/qbzd \
  | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/qbzd.service >/dev/null
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now qbzd
sudo systemctl status qbzd
```

`--system` changes who owns and manages the unit; it deliberately does **not**
run the audio player as root. The generated unit contains `User=`, `HOME=` and
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=` for the selected account. Keep that account in the `audio`
group when using ALSA Direct, and enable linger when its PipeWire/Pulse socket
lives under `/run/user/<uid>`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG audio "$USER"
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

HiFiBerryOS Next Generation can register an external player through drop-in
files. Point its `systemd_service` field at `qbzd`; the upstream
[Add your own player](https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-os/blob/main/docs/add-your-own-player.md)
guide documents the player descriptor, AudioControl registration and
config-server permission files. A native HiFiBerry package can therefore own
the unit and expose its on/off switch without making `qbzd` a root process.

## Read-only root filesystems

All default profile paths follow the standard XDG variables. Redirect them to
writable mounts before running `qbzd setup`, then use the same environment in
the service. This example keeps configuration and databases on persistent
storage while putting disposable cache data in RAM (replace `/data` and the
`qbz` account with paths/usernames from the appliance):

```bash
sudo install -d -o qbz -g qbz /data/qbzd-config /data/qbzd-data
sudo -u qbz env \
  XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/data/qbzd-config \
  XDG_DATA_HOME=/data/qbzd-data \
  XDG_CACHE_HOME=/run/qbzd-cache \
  /usr/bin/qbzd setup
```

Add the same paths to the system unit with `sudo systemctl edit qbzd`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/data/qbzd-config
Environment=XDG_DATA_HOME=/data/qbzd-data
Environment=XDG_CACHE_HOME=/run/qbzd-cache
RuntimeDirectory=qbzd-cache
RuntimeDirectoryMode=0700
```

After `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart qbzd`, the roots
reported by `qbzd status` should all be writable. As a simpler container-style
alternative, set `data_root = "/writable/qbzd-state"` in `qbzd.toml`; this
moves both application data and its cache below that directory. The XDG config
root still holds `qbzd.toml` and the login credential, so it must remain
readable (and writable whenever login/settings are changed).

## Why glibc 2.35

This binary is built on ubuntu-22.04 (glibc 2.35) specifically so it runs on
Raspberry Pi OS bookworm (glibc 2.36) and similarly-aged distros without a
rebuild — see `qbz-nix-docs/qbz-daemon/01-architecture.md` (D13).
