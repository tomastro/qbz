# build-aarch64-qbzd.sh — build the Linux aarch64 (ARM64) `qbzd` daemon binary,
# e.g. for a Raspberry Pi 4 + HiFiBerry/USB DAC streamer.
#
# ── Why this is NOT build-aarch64-linux.sh ───────────────────────────────────
# That script builds the Qt desktop `qbz`, which needs a Qt >= 6.8 with private
# headers on the build host and cannot be cross-compiled with cross-rs (the
# target Qt's qmake has to run during the build). `qbzd` is the Qt-free and
# Slint-free column of the workspace: no UI crate, no fonts, no GPU libs. It
# builds in minutes on modest hardware and cross-compiles cleanly, so:
#   • a 4 GB Pi CAN build it natively;
#   • CROSS mode via cross-rs + crates/Cross.toml still works here;
#   • the container caps are small.
#
# Two modes, auto-selected by host arch (same shape as the desktop script):
#
#   1. NATIVE  (on aarch64 Linux: the Pi itself, an ARM VM/runner)
#   2. CROSS   (on x86-64 Linux with Docker, via `cross`; crates/Cross.toml
#              supplies the arm64 dev libs inside the image)
#
# Output: dist/qbzd-aarch64-linux (an aarch64 ELF — verify with `file`).
