# QBZ Qt/QML — build with cargo, then run the BINARY DIRECTLY.
#
# The Qt-track sibling of slint-run.sh. Same shape (build, learned ETA, exec the
# prebuilt binary so process monitors show `qbz-qt` instead of `cargo`), but the
# constraints are almost the opposite — read the two sections below before
# "improving" this script into a copy of slint-run.sh.
#
# ─── THERE IS NO MEMORY WALL HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────
# slint-run.sh tiers threads/codegen-units/opt-level off MemAvailable and runs
# under a cgroup cap because ONE rustc for `qbz-ui` (the ~1.6 M-line generated
# Slint module) peaks 20-30 GB and can freeze the box.
# `qbz-qt` does NOT depend on `qbz-ui` — verified: zero `qbz-ui` references in
# crates/qbz-qt/Cargo.toml, so the monster compilation unit never enters this
# graph. The UI lives in QML, which does not go through rustc at all; that is
# the entire point of the Qt track. So: no tiering, no cap, ordinary jobs.
# The box-wide "ONE build at a time" rule still applies (a Slint build running
# in another worktree WILL freeze the machine) — hence the guard below.
#
# ─── THE CACHE RULE — WHY THIS SCRIPT SETS NO RUSTFLAGS ─────────────────────
# RUSTFLAGS is part of every unit's fingerprint. This worktree's target dir was
# built on STABLE with rustflags=[] (checked in the .fingerprint json). Exporting
# anything — mold, `-Z threads`, a target-feature — invalidates the whole
# workspace and buys a from-scratch rebuild of ~200 crates to save seconds on a
# ~2-minute incremental. Same reason there is no `+nightly` here: nothing in
# qbz-qt needs it, and switching toolchains is another full rebuild.
# MOLD=1 opts in anyway (it warns first). If you use it, keep using it.
#
# ─── THE QML AUDITS RUN FIRST, BY DESIGN ────────────────────────────────────
# `cargo check` sees NOTHING of the QML: a missing component or a call to a
# bridge member that does not exist compiles clean and throws when the user
# opens that view. The five static audits are ~1s and catch exactly that, so they
# run BEFORE the build — failing in one second beats failing after two minutes,
# or worse, at the owner's smoke. NO_AUDIT=1 skips them.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/qt-run.sh [extra app args]
#   DEBUG=1     ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # debug profile (the binary the gate uses)
#   NORUN=1     ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # build only, don't exec
#   TEST=1      ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # also run `cargo test -p qbz-qt`
#   SMOKE=1     ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # offscreen gate instead of the GUI
#   NO_AUDIT=1  ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # skip the five QML audits
#   JOBS=4      ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # cargo build jobs (default: auto)
#   MOLD=1      ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # link with mold (forces a full rebuild)
#   FORCE=1     ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # build even if another cargo/rustc is up
#   NO_TICKER=1 ./scripts/qt-run.sh   # no live progress ticker
